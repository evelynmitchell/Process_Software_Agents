# User Story: The Engineering Manager

## "Finally, I can sleep on release night."

**Persona:** Sarah, Director of Engineering
**Team Size:** 15 Developers (3 squads)
**Pain Point:** "Black Box" AI code and unpredictable quality.

### The Situation

Sarah was excited about AI coding tools, but the excitement turned to dread when her team started shipping "AI spaghetti." Velocity went up, but so did the bug count. Junior developers were accepting code they didn't understand, and senior developers were burning out doing code reviews that were essentially complete rewrites.

*"It felt like we were building a skyscraper out of cardboard. Fast to build, but one strong wind and it all comes down,"* Sarah recalls.

### The Turning Point: ASP

Sarah implemented the **Agentic Software Process (ASP) Platform** not to replace her developers, but to give them a safety net. She started by using the platform for "boring but critical" tasks: internal tooling, data migration scripts, and integration tests.

### How She Uses It

1.  **Visibility via Telemetry:** Sarah doesn't have to nag her team for updates. She looks at the **Langfuse Dashboard** integrated with ASP. She sees exactly how much each task costs in API credits and, more importantly, the **Phase Yield**.
    *   *"I saw that the 'Design Review Agent' was catching 60% of potential bugs before a single line of code was written. That's money in the bank."*

2.  **Cost Control:** Instead of an open-ended "copilot" bill, Sarah sees the **Cost Vector** for every task.
    *   *"I know that 'Feature X' cost exactly $2.45 to generate and test. I can budget for that."*

3.  **Quality Gates:** The ASP Platform's strict **Gated Review** process means that no code moves to the testing phase until it passes the Code Review Agent's checks (Security, Style, Performance).
    *   *"It's like having a strict but fair senior architect who reviews every single PR instantly."*

### The Outcome

Three months in, Sarah's team is shipping faster, but the "rework" rate has dropped by 40%. The "Postmortem Agent" even suggests process improvements automatically.

*"The emotional weight of 'what if it breaks' is gone. I trust the process because I can measure the process. My seniors are mentoring again instead of just fixing AI bugs, and my juniors are learning from the feedback the agents provide."*

### Key Features Used
*   **7 Specialized Agents** (specifically Design Review and Code Review)
*   **Telemetry & Observability** (Langfuse integration)
*   **Phase Yield Metrics**
*   **Postmortem Analysis**
