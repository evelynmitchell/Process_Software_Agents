# User Story: The Product Manager

## "I finally have an estimate I can trust."

**Persona:** Jordan, Product Manager
**Goal:** Predictability and Feature Velocity
**Pain Point:** "It'll be done in two days" (Narrator: It took two weeks).

### The Situation

Jordan's relationship with the engineering team was... strained. Every sprint planning meeting was a negotiation. Estimates were wild guesses. Stakeholders were angry about missed deadlines. Jordan felt like he was flying blind, unable to promise anything to customers.

*"I don't need it done *instantly*, I just need to know *when* it will be done so I can plan the marketing launch,"* Jordan often vented.

### The Turning Point: ASP

The engineering lead introduced Jordan to the **ASP Platform's PROBE-AI Estimation**. Jordan didn't care about the code or the agents; he cared about the data.

### How He Uses It

1.  **Data-Backed Estimation:** When Jordan proposes a new feature, the **PROBE-AI** component analyzes the requirements against historical data of similar tasks.
    *   *"Instead of a developer guessing 'maybe 3 points?', the system says 'Based on complexity, this is likely 4.5 hours of agent time + 2 hours of human review'. That's specific."*

2.  **Velocity Tracking:** Jordan watches the **Bootstrap Learning** progress. He sees the agents "graduating" from Learning Mode to Autonomous Mode.
    *   *"It's exciting to see. 'Oh, the Test Agent is now 90% reliable.' That tells me our velocity is about to increase."*

3.  **Requirements Clarity:** The **Planning Agent** forces Jordan (and the team) to be specific. If a requirement is vague, the agent asks for clarification *before* starting.
    *   *"It forces us to be disciplined. I can't just say 'make it pop'. I have to define what 'pop' means. And that saves us weeks of back-and-forth later."*

### The Outcome

Confidence. That's the main emotion Jordan feels now. When he tells the VP of Marketing that a feature will drop on Tuesday, he believes it. The friction between Product and Engineering has turned into collaboration.

*"We're not arguing about dates anymore. We're looking at the data together. If the ASP says it's complex, we simplify the scope. It's transformed how we manage expectations."*

### Key Features Used
