### Current State

**Tests:**
- 698 tests passing, 1 skipped
- 78% coverage (target: 80%)
- All linting clean (black, isort, ruff)

**Open Branches:**
- `claude/review-summary-branches-01TeTdTNZPmG3oMbqpqygZb6` (Session 1 work)
- `claude/review-and-plan-01Y7xKznDc8jt6yvHiks9ML6` (This session)

**PRs:**
- All December 1st PRs (#75-#80) merged

### Recommended Next Steps

#### Priority 1: Merge Session 1 Branch
The session 1 branch has significant value:
- +54 new tests
- 5% coverage increase
- ADR 002 documentation
- Should be merged to main

#### Priority 2: Reach 80% Test Coverage (Need 2% more)

From the coverage analysis, these modules need attention:
| Module | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Low-coverage modules | TBD | 80%+ | 2% overall |

**Options to close the gap:**
1. Add more edge case tests to existing test files
2. Cover remaining untested functions in high-value modules
3. Add tests for error handling paths

#### Priority 3: Web UI Integration

The Web UI (FastHTML-based) currently shows mock/sample data. Next steps:
- Connect dashboards to actual TSP orchestrator
- Wire up real task execution
- Add live telemetry display

#### Priority 4: Address Remaining Items

From weekly reflection and session notes:
- Security vulnerability (Dependabot alert)
- E2E mock schema alignment (currently 50%)
- Multi-repo Phase 2-4 implementation
- Validate user stories with stakeholders

### Status
Planning session - ready to proceed with recommended work.
