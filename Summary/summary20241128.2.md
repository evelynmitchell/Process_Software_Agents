# Session Summary - 2024-11-28 Session 2

## Overview
Review and fix failing unit tests in the Process_Software_Agents repository.

## Branch
`claude/fix-failing-tests-013NQgHH35f8MGyQq9wEJNLL`

## Test Environment
- Using `uv` for dependency management
- Python 3.12.3
- pytest 9.0.0

## Failing Tests Analysis

### Test Categories
The repository contains tests for the ASP (Autonomous Software Process) system:
- **approval/** - Branch management, PR workflows, merge control
- **e2e/** - End-to-end tests of the ASP workflow
- **integration/** - Integration tests for agent interactions
- **unit/** - Unit tests for individual components

### Initial Test Run Results
Running `uv run pytest -v` showed multiple test failures across:
1. Git utilities tests (ERROR - likely permission/setup issues)
2. LLM client tests (FAILED - API/configuration issues)
3. Approval workflow tests (ERROR - git setup issues)

## Next Steps
1. Review each failing test category
2. Determine if tests should be:
   - Fixed (implementation bug)
   - Modified (test assumptions changed)
   - Removed (no longer relevant)
3. Document decisions and rationale
4. Commit fixes

## Questions to Address
- Are all these tests still relevant to the current codebase?
- Do some tests have environmental dependencies that need setup?
- Are there tests that duplicate coverage or are obsolete?
