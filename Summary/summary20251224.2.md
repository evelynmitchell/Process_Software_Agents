# Session Summary - 2025-12-24 Session 2

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## ADR Status Analysis

### Completed ADRs (in `design/Done/`)

| ADR | Title | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 001 | Workspace Isolation | Complete |
| 002 | Git Signing in Tests | Complete |
| 006 | Repair Workflow | Complete |
| 007 | GitHub Integration | Complete |
| 008 | Async Architecture | Complete |
| 009 | Beads Integration | Complete |

### Open ADRs (in `design/`)

| ADR | Title | Status | Priority | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| **003** | OpenTelemetry RL Triplets | Proposed | Medium | Foundation for RL training |
| **004** | Process Graph Learning | Proposed | Low | Depends on ADR 003 |
| **005** | Dev Process Graph Learning | Proposed | Deferred | Moved to separate repo |
| **010** | Multi-LLM Providers | **In Progress** | **High** | 5/14 phases done |
| **011** | Claude CLI/Agent SDK | Draft | Medium | Not started |
| **012** | MCP Server Hooks | Complete | - | 8 tools implemented |
| **013** | Logfire Migration | Complete | - | Phases 1-2 done |
| **014** | Web UI Deprecation | Draft | Low | ADR doc only, not implemented |
| **015** | Wide Events Logging | Draft | Low | ADR doc only, not implemented |

### ADR 010: Multi-LLM Provider Support - Phase Details

**Status:** In Progress - 5/14 phases complete

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Provider abstraction layer | **Complete** |
| 2 | Anthropic provider refactor | **Complete** |
| 3 | OpenRouter provider | **Complete** |
| 4 | Gemini provider | **Pending - Next Priority** |
| 5 | Groq provider | **Complete** |
| 6 | Together provider | Pending |
| 7 | Fireworks provider | Pending |
| 8 | DeepInfra provider | Pending |
| 9 | Ollama provider | Pending |
| 10 | vLLM provider | Pending |
| 11 | Cloudflare provider | Pending |
| 12 | Claude CLI provider | Pending |
| 13 | CLI integration (--provider/--model) | **Complete** |
| 14 | Documentation | Partial |

### Recommended Next ADR Work

**Priority 1: ADR 010 Phase 4 - Gemini Provider**
- Add Google AI/Gemini as a provider
- Requires `google-generativeai` SDK
- Would enable access to Gemini 2.0 models

**Priority 2: ADR 010 Phases 6-10 - OpenAI-Compatible Providers**
- Together, Fireworks, DeepInfra are all OpenAI-compatible
- Can likely share base implementation
- Fast to add once pattern established

**Priority 3: ADR 011 - Claude CLI/Agent SDK Integration**
- Would enable subscription billing (Claude Pro/Max)
- Leverages built-in tools
- Partially overlaps with ADR 010 Phase 12

**Lower Priority (ADR docs exist, no urgent implementation need):**
- ADR 014: Web UI Deprecation - reduces maintenance but not blocking
- ADR 015: Wide Events Logging - philosophy change, can happen gradually
- ADR 003/004: RL instrumentation - research-oriented, can wait

## Technical Notes

### Key Finding: ADR 010 is the Active Work

ADR 010 (Multi-LLM Provider Support) is the only ADR currently "In Progress" with partial implementation. The abstraction layer is in place with Anthropic, OpenRouter, and Groq providers working. The CLI integration (`--provider`, `--model` flags) is also complete.

### ADRs 014 and 015 - Documentation vs Implementation

Both ADR 014 (Web UI Deprecation) and ADR 015 (Wide Events Logging) have merged ADR documents but no implementation work. They represent future direction but are not blocking current work.

### Test Coverage Status (from 20251223.3)

- 1773 tests passing
- 75.23% coverage (target met)

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **ADR 010 Phase 4** - Add Gemini provider (if continuing provider work)
2. **ADR 010 Phases 6-7** - Add Together/Fireworks providers (OpenAI-compatible)
3. **ADR 011** - Evaluate Claude Agent SDK integration approach
4. **Branch cleanup** - Delete merged feature branches
