# Session Summary - 2025-12-24 Session 2

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-24 Session 1 (summary20251224.1.md)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [x] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [ ] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**Summary:** Session 1 created provider e2e tests. This session reviewed and fixed minor issues found in code review.

## Work Completed

### GitHub Catch-up
- Checked repository status (2 open PRs: #120, #121)
- Reviewed PR #120 in detail

### PR #120 Code Review
Conducted thorough review of provider e2e tests PR, identifying:
1. Workflow filename mismatch in docstring
2. Missing `tests/e2e/__init__.py`
3. Overly broad exception catch (`Exception`) in invalid key tests
4. Model names verified correct (claude-haiku-4-5 matches codebase)
5. Workflow Summary step reviewed (actually correct)

### Fixes Applied
1. **Fixed workflow filename reference** - Changed `provider-e2e-tests.yml` to `provider-e2e.yml` in test docstring
2. **Created `tests/e2e/__init__.py`** - Added package init file for proper test discovery
3. **Narrowed exception types** - Removed `Exception` from pytest.raises, keeping only `(AuthenticationError, ProviderError)`
