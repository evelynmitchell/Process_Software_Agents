# Session Summary - 2025-12-04 Session 1

## Objective
Discuss process mining from telemetry and property-based testing for the Process Software Agents project.

## Prior Session Summary (December 3rd)

| Session | Focus | Key Outcome |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | OpenTelemetry RL Triplets | ADR 003 created, flexible triplet schema designed |

**Key Decisions from Dec 3:**
- Created ADR 003: OpenTelemetry RL Triplet Instrumentation
- Designed flexible triplet schema: `(state: dict, action: dict, reward: float | None)`
- Reward range: 0.0 to 1.0 continuous
- Sequence scoping: agent, pipeline, or session level
- Deferred reward assignment pattern

## Today's Discussion Topics

### 1. Process Mining from Telemetry

Process mining applies data mining to event logs to discover, monitor, and improve processes. Relevant to this project because:

- **Existing data sources**:
  - SQLite telemetry (`asp_telemetry.db`) with `agent_cost_vector` and `defect_log`
  - Langfuse traces for LLM calls
  - Planned OpenTelemetry RL triplets

- **Potential applications**:
  - Discover actual agent workflow patterns vs designed patterns
  - Identify bottlenecks in TSP orchestration
  - Conformance checking: do agents follow expected process models?
  - Performance analysis: where do delays/costs accumulate?

### 2. Property-Based Testing

Property-based testing (PBT) generates test cases from specifications rather than manually writing examples. Relevant to this project because:

- **Current testing**: pytest with unit/integration tests at 74% coverage
- **PBT tools for Python**: Hypothesis is the standard library
- **Good candidates for PBT in this codebase**:
  - Agent input/output validation (arbitrary task descriptions)
  - Data layer functions (simulate_timeline, cost calculations)
  - Schema validation (triplet schemas, artifact schemas)
  - Serialization round-trips (JSON ↔ dataclass)

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Process Mining**: What specific processes do we want to mine? Agent-level or pipeline-level?
2. **Process Mining Tools**: PM4Py (Python) vs commercial tools?
3. **Property Testing**: Which components would benefit most from Hypothesis?
4. **Integration**: How do these connect with the RL triplet work from ADR 003?
