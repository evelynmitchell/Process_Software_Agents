# Session Summary - 2025-12-11 Session 3

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

- [ ] Status updated to Complete/Blocked

### Required (Human fills)
- [ ] Previous session outcome assessed (or "N/A" if first)
- [ ] Interventions logged (or "none" noted)
- [ ] Rating provided (1-5)

### Optional but Valuable

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-11 Session 2 (Testing Strategies)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**Summary of Session 2 work:**
- Created `design/testing_strategies.md` (~710 lines)
- Covers: combination testing, DoE, Hypothesis, mutation testing
- Opt-in enablement via pytest markers for compute control

---

## Work Completed

- Explored current async usage in codebase (partial - RepairOrchestrator, review orchestrators)
- Drafted ADR 008: Async Process Architecture covering:
  - Async LLM calls (foundation)
  - Parallel agent execution patterns
  - Async services (subprocess, file I/O)
  - Rate limiting and backpressure
  - Incremental migration strategy (5 phases)
  - Dual interface pattern for backward compatibility
