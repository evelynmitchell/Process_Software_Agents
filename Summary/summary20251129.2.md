# Session 20251129.2 Summary

**Date:** November 29, 2025
**Session ID:** 20251129.2
**Branch:** claude/create-session-summary-01R1kSaibhjRq2FBr741i1FW

## Goals
- Design naming/namespacing for multi-project Langfuse support
- Investigate Langfuse tags and metadata features
- Test external repo workflow with WorkspaceManager

## Key Context from Session 20251129.1

**Weekly Review Completed:**
- All 5 PRD phases complete (100% delivered)
- 25+ sessions across Nov 23-28
- WorkspaceManager implemented with 22 passing tests
- Documentation suite created (~250 KB)

**Next Priority Identified:** Naming/namespacing for multi-project support
- User plans to try ASP on another codebase
- Need to distinguish projects in single Langfuse instance
- Current task IDs don't indicate project context

## Session 2 Focus: Multi-Project Naming Design

### Current State
- Task IDs: `TSP-FIB-001`, `HW-001` (no project context)
- Langfuse traces: No project tagging
- WorkspaceManager: Project-agnostic

### Design Questions to Address
1. What metadata is essential vs nice-to-have?
2. Should project context be inferred (git) or explicit (config)?
3. How to handle same task ID in different projects?
4. What Langfuse features to leverage (tags, metadata, sessions)?
5. How does this interact with WorkspaceManager?
