# Session 20251129.2 Summary

**Date:** November 29, 2025
**Session ID:** 20251129.2
**Branch:** claude/create-session-summary-01R1kSaibhjRq2FBr741i1FW

## Goals
- Design naming/namespacing for multi-project Langfuse support
- Investigate Langfuse tags and metadata features
- Test external repo workflow with WorkspaceManager

## Key Context from Session 20251129.1

**Weekly Review Completed:**
- All 5 PRD phases complete (100% delivered)
- 25+ sessions across Nov 23-28
- WorkspaceManager implemented with 22 passing tests
- Documentation suite created (~250 KB)

**Next Priority Identified:** Naming/namespacing for multi-project support
- User plans to try ASP on another codebase
- Need to distinguish projects in single Langfuse instance
- Current task IDs don't indicate project context

## Session 2 Focus: Multi-Project Naming Design

### Current State
- Task IDs: `TSP-FIB-001`, `HW-001` (no project context)
- Langfuse traces: No project tagging
- WorkspaceManager: Project-agnostic

### Design Questions to Address
1. What metadata is essential vs nice-to-have?
2. Should project context be inferred (git) or explicit (config)?
3. How to handle same task ID in different projects?
4. What Langfuse features to leverage (tags, metadata, sessions)?
5. How does this interact with WorkspaceManager?

## Activities

### 1. Session Setup
- Reviewed session 20251129.1 summary and weekly review
- Merged session 1 branch changes
- Created this session summary

### 2. External Repo Workflow Test - COMPLETE

**Objective:** Validate WorkspaceManager with actual external repository clone workflow

**Test Setup:**
- Created local bare git repo at `/tmp/asp-test-repos/sample-external-repo.git`
- Populated with sample project (README.md, app.py)

**Workflow Tested:**

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Create workspace | `/tmp/asp-workspaces/external-repo-test-001` |
| 2 | Clone external repo | `file:///...sample-external-repo.git` - SUCCESS |
| 3 | Create feature branch | `feature/add-tests` |
| 4 | Make code changes | Added `test_app.py`, improved `app.py` |
| 5 | Store ASP artifacts | `.asp/planning.json`, `.asp/code_review.json` |
| 6 | Commit changes | 2 commits in history |
| 7 | Verify isolation | Workspace NOT in Process_Software_Agents |
| 8 | Cleanup | Workspace fully removed |

**Key Validations:**
- ✅ Clone from external repo works (via file:// URL)
- ✅ Feature branch workflow works
- ✅ ASP artifacts stored in `.asp/` (not in git)
- ✅ Commits succeed with proper git config
- ✅ Workspace fully isolated from main codebase
- ✅ Cleanup removes all traces

**Observation:** This is the first time the clone workflow has been exercised with an actual repository (previous tests used `initialize_git_repo()` only).

### 3. [Naming/Namespacing Design - Pending]

(Remaining session goal - discuss with user)

## Deliverables

### Created This Session
1. `Summary/summary20251129.2.md` - This session summary

### Completed
- [x] External repo workflow test - VALIDATED
