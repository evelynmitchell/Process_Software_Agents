## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Technical Notes

### Tailwind Dynamic Class Fix
- Tailwind purges unused classes at build time
- Dynamic classes like `border-${color}` don't work
- Solution: use inline styles with actual hex color values

### Beads Integration
- `.beads/issues.jsonl` should be tracked in git (not gitignored)
- Beads is designed as a git-native issue tracker
- File emptied but kept for future use

## Next Session Priorities

- Review/merge PR number 100 after verifying fixes
- Merge PR number 1 in luce_beach
- Implement core option screening logic in luce_beach
