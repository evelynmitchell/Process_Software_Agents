# Session Summary - 2025-12-16 Session 1

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## Completeness Checklist

Before closing the session, verify:

### Required (Claude fills)
- [x] Metadata complete (date, session#, commits, status)
- [ ] Objective is one clear sentence
- [ ] Work completed has concrete deliverables
- [ ] Files changed table is accurate
- [ ] End commit hash updated
- [ ] Status updated to Complete/Blocked

### Required (Human fills)
- [ ] Previous session outcome assessed (or "N/A" if first)
- [ ] Interventions logged (or "none" noted)
- [ ] Rating provided (1-5)

### Optional but Valuable
- [ ] What worked / didn't work filled in
- [ ] Technical notes for future sessions
- [ ] Next session priorities listed

**Completeness Score:** 1/6 required (Claude), ___/3 required (Human), 0/3 optional

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-15 Session 4

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**Summary of Yesterday (2025-12-15):**

### Session 1
- Installed missing test dependencies (pytest-asyncio, playwright, allpairspy, hypothesis)
- Fixed test collection errors - all 1404 tests now collect
- Reviewed PR #100 (Beads Integration) - requested changes
- Set up luce_beach private repo project structure

### Session 2
- Fixed all PR #100 code review issues:
  - Removed unused imports
  - Fixed deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
  - Replaced print() with proper logging
  - Fixed Tailwind dynamic class issues with inline styles
  - Emptied test data from `.beads/issues.jsonl`

### Session 3
- Created ADR 009: Beads and Planning Agent Integration
- Defined 3 integration points (manual CLI, Kanban action, auto-sync)
- Designed pure hash-based ID conventions
- Added migration plan for converting existing ASP task numbering

### Session 4
- Added bidirectional GitHub sync to ADR 009 Phase 4:
  - `import_from_github()` and `sync_bidirectional()` functions
  - Three conflict resolution strategies
  - CLI commands: `asp beads push/pull/sync`

## Work Completed

- Created session summary for 2025-12-16 Session 1
- Reviewed previous day's work (4 sessions)
- Created feature branch `feature/hash-based-ids` for migration work
- Comprehensive codebase analysis of ID patterns:
  - Found 6 sequential ID patterns with validation (SU-xxx, ISSUE-xxx, IMPROVE-xxx, CODE-ISSUE-xxx, CODE-IMPROVE-xxx, CHECK-xxx)
  - Beads already uses hash-based IDs (`bd-{5-char-hex}`)
  - Identified orchestrator post-processing that regenerates IDs
- Test impact analysis:
  - ~151 test methods across 69 test files affected
  - ~47 tests with explicit pattern validation
  - ~104 tests using sample IDs in fixtures
- Created detailed migration analysis document (`design/hash_based_id_migration_analysis.md`):
  - 4-phase migration strategy
  - Complete file change list (13 source files, 69 test files)
  - Risk assessment and backward compatibility plan

## Technical Notes

### Carried Over from Yesterday

**Next Session Priorities from Session 4:**
- Implement Phase 1 of ADR 009: Manual CLI trigger (`asp beads process`)
- Add tests for CLI commands
- Consider implementing Phase 4 import function for immediate use

---

## Next Session Priorities

- Implement Phase 1: Create `src/asp/utils/id_generation.py` utility module
- Implement Phase 2: Update model patterns to accept hash-based format
- Run test suite to identify breaking tests
- Update test fixtures in `tests/unit/conftest.py`
