## Work Completed

### 1. Weekly Reflection (Nov 30 - Dec 6, 2025)

Created comprehensive weekly reflection document covering the past week's development.

**Key Findings:**

| Metric | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Test Coverage | 39% → 76% (+37%) |
| Web UI Tasks | 0/13 → 13/13 (100%) |
| New Tests | 250+ added |
| ADRs Created | 4 new (002-005) |
| Commits | 141 |

**What Went Well:**
- Web UI completion (all three personas functional)
- Test coverage nearly doubled
- Architectural vision clear (RL triplets, process mining ADRs)
- CI/CD fully stabilized

**What Didn't Go Well:**
- Still 4% short of 80% coverage target
- ADRs 003-005 not yet implemented
- No dogfooding feedback loop

**Overall Assessment:** A- (Excellent with minor gaps)

### 2. Strategic Discussion

Discussed concerns about project direction:

#### UI Complexity
- Three personas (Manager, Developer, Product Manager) may be over-engineered
- Each adds surface area and maintenance burden without proving core value
- Options considered:
  1. Simplify to one focused dashboard
  2. Split into separate tools
  3. Focus on Developer view for dogfooding

#### Missing Feedback Loop
- Key gap: We're not using ASP to develop ASP
- Have the data (session summaries, git, telemetry) but no automated analysis
- Process mining tool created separately could help close this loop

#### Simple Improvement Metric
Discussed candidates for measuring improvement:

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Rework rate | Hard to define "rework" |
| Time-to-merge | Simple but ignores quality |
| Defects escaped | Lagging indicator |
| Sessions per feature | Penalizes thoroughness |
| **Interventions per task** | Most actionable - measures autonomy |

**"Interventions per task"** emerged as promising - directly measures how often humans need to course-correct AI during tasks.

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Summary/weekly_reflection_20251206.md` | Weekly reflection document |
| `Summary/summary20251206.1.md` | This session summary |

## Open Questions (For Future Sessions)

1. **UI Focus:** One dashboard vs separate tools vs Developer-only?
2. **Dogfooding:** How to use ASP to develop ASP?
3. **Metric:** Is "interventions per task" the right simple metric?
4. **Process Mining Integration:** How to connect the new tool to this project?

## Next Steps

Decisions deferred - user pondering direction. Potential paths:
- Simplify UI to single focused view
- Prioritize dogfooding setup
- Define and instrument improvement metric
- Integrate process mining tool
