# Session 7 Summary - 2025-12-01

## Task: Detailed User Stories and Scenario Journeys

### Objective
Expand user story documentation to cover detailed day-to-day workflows and realistic end-to-end scenarios showing how each role (Developer, Engineering Manager, Product Manager) would accomplish their tasks using the ASP platform.

### Context
Previous sessions (1-6 today) built the Web UI with three persona dashboards. Existing user stories were high-level narratives. This session focused on the practical "how" - specific inputs, outputs, actions, and decision points for daily work.

### Documents Created

#### 1. Detailed Workflows (`docs/user_stories_detailed_workflows.md`)
**~1,200 lines covering:**

**Developer (Alex) Workflows:**
| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| D1: Starting a New Feature | From requirements to planning to design |
| D2: Generating Code | Design to implementation with review |
| D3: Generating Tests | Code to comprehensive test coverage |
| D4: Debugging Test Failures | Failure analysis and fix generation |
| D5: Code Review | Reviewing others' PRs with AI assistance |
| D6: Refactoring | Safe refactoring with test safety nets |
| D7: Security Fixes | CVE response and remediation |

**Engineering Manager (Sarah) Workflows:**
| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| M1: Morning Health Check | Daily dashboard review, alerts, team status |
| M2: Sprint Planning Review | PROBE-AI estimates, capacity vs. scope |
| M3: Quality Gate Review | Phase yield, defects, SLO comparison |
| M4: Budget Management | Cost tracking, efficiency, guardrails |
| M5: Incident Response | Root cause analysis, postmortems |
| M6: Team Performance Review | Individual metrics, coaching opportunities |

**Product Manager (Jordan) Workflows:**
| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| P1: Feature Scoping | Natural language to structured requirements |
| P2: Roadmap Planning | Timeline simulation, confidence intervals |
| P3: Sprint Grooming | Backlog refinement, readiness scoring |
| P4: Stakeholder Updates | Auto-generated status reports |
| P5: Release Planning | Go/No-Go decisions with risk assessment |
| P6: Requirements Refinement | Feedback integration, re-estimation |

**Additional Sections:**
- Cross-role interactions (handoffs, escalations, notifications)
- Comprehensive inputs/outputs reference tables
- Daily rhythm schedules for each role

#### 2. Scenario Journeys (`docs/user_stories_scenario_journeys.md`)
**~1,100 lines covering 8 end-to-end scenarios:**

| Scenario | Theme | Key Learnings |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| 1: The Urgent Feature | Deadline pressure | PROBE-AI estimates enable quick decisions |
| 2: The Production Incident | 2 AM crisis | Postmortem Agent enables rapid root cause |
| 3: The New Team Member | Onboarding | Learning mode guides junior developers |
| 4: The Quarterly Release | Complex release | Data-driven scope decisions |
| 5: Technical Debt Paydown | Refactoring | Test generation enables safe changes |
| 6: Competitive Response | Market pressure | Quick scope + phased approach |
| 7: Budget Crunch | Cost overrun | Optimization without output reduction |
| 8: Failed Sprint | Recovery | Process improvements from data |

### Key Insights Documented

**Inputs to ASP System:**
- Natural language requirements
- Code context (files, APIs, schemas)
- Constraints (budget, time, quality)
- Historical data (previous tasks, patterns)

**Outputs from ASP System:**
- Structured artifacts (plans, designs, code, tests)
- Metrics (estimates, confidence, cost, quality)
- Recommendations (fixes, process improvements)
- Alerts (anomalies, budget, quality gates)

**Decision Points Enabled:**
- Go/No-Go on features/releases
- Scope adjustments based on data
- Resource allocation based on capacity
- Process changes based on postmortems

### Git Activity
- **Branch:** `claude/review-user-stories-01MdVGY4mg4GNrzQpUcC8EaZ`
- **Commit:** `1133ebb` - Add detailed user stories and scenario journeys documentation
- **Files Added:** 2
- **Lines Added:** 2,315

### How This Supports Product Development

These documents answer:
1. **What do users DO?** - Specific workflows by role
2. **What do they INPUT?** - Requirements, context, constraints
3. **What do they GET?** - Artifacts, metrics, recommendations
4. **What do they DECIDE?** - Go/no-go, priorities, process changes
5. **What goes WRONG?** - Failure scenarios and recovery paths

### Status
Complete - Ready for review

### Next Steps
1. Review scenarios with actual users for validation
2. Use workflows to guide UI feature priorities
3. Map inputs/outputs to actual API design
4. Create test scenarios from journey descriptions
