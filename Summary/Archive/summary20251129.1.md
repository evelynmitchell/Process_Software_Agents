# Session 20251129.1 Summary

**Date:** November 29, 2025
**Session ID:** 20251129.1
**Branch:** claude/weekly-review-followup-019vkD4tByhZiKh9BqwsJysc

## Goals
- Create session summary file for today's first session
- Review last week's summaries and work done (November 23-28, 2025)
- Write a weekly review reflecting on what went well, what went less well, and opportunities for improvement

## Activities

### 1. Session Initialization
- Reviewed last week's weekly reflection (November 15-22, 2025)
- Read all session summaries from November 23-28, 2025:
  - November 23: Sessions 1-2 (Repository management strategy, Test artifacts repository)
  - November 24: Session 1 (Security fixes, Local PR HITL Architecture)
  - November 25: Sessions 1-6 (Local PR HITL implementation, TSP integration, E2E validation, Postmortem fixes, Documentation, Phase 5 implementation)
  - November 26: Sessions 1-6 (Test suite refactoring, test fixes, E2E mock improvements)
  - November 28: Sessions 1-9 (Test improvements, CI/CD setup, branch cleanup, multi-repo workflow architecture, WorkspaceManager implementation)

### 2. Weekly Review Creation
- Created comprehensive weekly review document analyzing:
  - Week's accomplishments and milestones
  - What went well (patterns to continue)
  - What didn't go as well (areas for improvement)
  - Unexpected discoveries
  - Key learnings and principles
  - Improvement opportunities for next week

## Key Context from This Week (November 23-28)

### Major Milestones Achieved
1. **Phase 5 Complete (100% PRD Delivered)** - Self-improvement loop fully implemented
2. **Local PR HITL Implementation** - Full git-based approval workflow with 28 tests
3. **TSP + HITL Integration** - Unified approval flow in orchestrator
4. **Comprehensive Documentation** - ~250 KB, 12,000 lines across 12 files
5. **Test Suite Stabilization** - 96.5% unit test pass rate (up from ~92%)
6. **WorkspaceManager Service** - Clean workspace isolation architecture
7. **CI/CD Infrastructure** - GitHub Actions with MkDocs documentation

### Session Counts
- November 23: 2 sessions
- November 24: 1 session
- November 25: 6 sessions
- November 26: 6 sessions
- November 27: 1 session (UI/UX documentation)
- November 28: 9 sessions (including gap at session 4)
- **Total: 25+ sessions across 6 days**

## Deliverables

### Created This Session
1. `Summary/summary20251129.1.md` - This session summary
2. `Summary/weekly_reflection_20251129.md` - Comprehensive weekly review

## Next Session Priority: Naming/Namespacing for Multi-Project Support

**Context:** User plans to try ASP on another codebase next week. Current naming conventions are adequate for testing but not specific or flexible enough for using ASP on multiple projects feeding into a single Langfuse instance.

### Current Challenges

- Task IDs like `TSP-FIB-001` or `HW-001` don't indicate which project they belong to
- Artifact paths don't include project context
- Langfuse traces from multiple projects would be hard to distinguish/query
- No organization/team-level grouping

### Areas to Consider

1. **Task ID Namespacing**
   - Options: `{project}/{task-id}`, `{org}/{project}/{task-id}`, or configurable patterns
   - Need to balance specificity with usability
   - Consider auto-detection from git remote or config file

2. **Langfuse Metadata**
   - Tags for project, organization, environment
   - Custom attributes for filtering and grouping
   - Session/trace naming conventions
   - How to query across projects vs within a project

3. **Artifact Path Conventions**
   - How to organize within workspaces
   - Consistent structure across different project types
   - Support for monorepo vs multi-repo

4. **Trace Naming**
   - Making traces queryable by project/org
   - Hierarchical naming (org > project > task > phase)
   - Human-readable vs machine-parseable

5. **Cross-Project Metrics**
   - Comparing PROBE data across projects
   - Aggregating improvement metrics
   - Per-project vs global baselines

### Design Principles (Preliminary)

- **Flexible:** Support various project structures (monorepo, multi-repo, different languages)
- **Configurable:** Allow customization without code changes
- **Backwards Compatible:** Don't break existing test artifacts
- **Queryable:** Enable effective Langfuse filtering and analysis
- **Human Readable:** Names should be meaningful to users

### Open Questions for Next Session

1. What metadata is essential vs nice-to-have?
2. Should project context be inferred (from git) or explicit (from config)?
3. How to handle the same task ID in different projects?
4. What Langfuse features should we leverage (tags, metadata, sessions)?
5. How does this interact with the WorkspaceManager?

**Note:** Target codebase for next week's trial is TBD - design should be flexible enough to accommodate various project types.
