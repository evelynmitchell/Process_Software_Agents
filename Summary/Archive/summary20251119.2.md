# Work Summary - November 19, 2025 - Session 2

## Session Overview

**Start Time:** Late Morning
**Date:** November 19, 2025 (Tuesday)
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Branch:** `claude/fix-merge-issue-01VRP6qaEqZV2AHb1HJbSgbL`

## Session Context

Critical documentation recovery. User reported that the last merge may have removed the README.

### Previous Session Recap

**Session 1 (Nov 19)** completed with:
- All specialist review agent tests passing (91/91, 100%)
- Emoji removal from entire codebase
- PR #12 merged successfully

## Work Completed

### 1. README.md Recovery

**Problem:** Merge commit 291ab2a accidentally replaced comprehensive README with minimal 3-line stub.

**Investigation:**
- Checked git status and file system - README.md existed but was only 3 lines
- Examined merge commit 291ab2a stats: showed 431 deletions from README.md
- Compared current README with pre-merge version (commit 934bd0e)
- Confirmed README was reduced from 430 lines to 3 lines

**Root Cause:**
During merge of PR #12 (`claude/remove-emojis-01TEb1kbREHqZJuRKcqHZ9C9`), the comprehensive Agentic Software Process (ASP) Platform README was accidentally replaced with a minimal stub:

```markdown
# Auth Service

Documentation here
```

**Solution:**
Restored full README.md content from commit 934bd0e (pre-merge state).

**Content Restored (430 lines):**
- Project overview and goals
- Quick start guides (GitHub Codespaces + Local Development)
- Project structure documentation
- Core concepts (PSP Adaptation, Bootstrap Learning, Quality Gates)
- Implementation status (3/7 agents complete)
- Design Review Agent documentation
- Complete documentation index
- Technology stack
- Development workflow
- Contributing guidelines
- Roadmap (5 phases)
- Contact information

### 2. Git Operations

**Commit Message:**
```
Restore README.md content lost in merge

The previous merge accidentally replaced the comprehensive README
documentation with a minimal "Auth Service" stub. This restores
the full Agentic Software Process (ASP) Platform documentation
including setup instructions, architecture overview, and all
project documentation.

### Test Coverage Summary
(No changes from Session 1)

**Overall: 274/274 tests passing (100%)**

## Files Modified

1. `README.md`:
   - Restored from 3 lines to 430 lines
   - Complete project documentation
   - All sections intact

## Lessons Learned

1. **Git merge conflicts** can silently replace files if not carefully reviewed
2. **Critical documentation** should be validated after merges
3. **Pre-merge commits** provide safety net for recovery
4. **Git show** is effective for extracting specific file versions from history

## Next Steps

Recommended priorities:
1. **Review merge process** to prevent future documentation loss
2. **Consider pre-commit hooks** for critical files
3. **Continue with Code Review Agent** implementation (FR-005)
4. **Bootstrap validation** for Code Agent

## Session Outcome

**SUCCESS:** README.md fully restored
- Recovered all 430 lines of comprehensive documentation
- No content loss
- Committed and pushed to feature branch
- Ready for PR or direct merge to main

**Session Status:** COMPLETE
**Next Session:** Continue with Code Review Agent implementation or improve merge safety
