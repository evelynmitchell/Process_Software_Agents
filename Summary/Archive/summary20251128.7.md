# Session 20251128.7 Summary

## Goals
- Create session summary
- Clean up and sync with main
- Review and organize all session 20251128 summaries

## Activities

### 1. Initial Cleanup
- Reviewed git changes (8 modified artifact files with timestamp updates)
- Reset artifact timestamp changes (not needed in git)
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `artifacts/` directory going forward
- Synced with main branch (242 commits pulled via rebase)

### 2. Session Summary Review
**Reviewed summaries from 20251128 sessions:**
- Session 1: Test suite improvements (8.1KB)
- Session 3: CI/CD setup and FastAOI investigation (4.8KB) - inconsistent naming
- Session 5: Branch cleanup analysis (4.1KB)
- Session 6: ASP multi-repo workflow (19KB) - very large
- Session 7: This session (1.3KB)
- **Missing:** Sessions 2 and 4

### 3. Session Summary Organization

**Renamed Session 3:**
- `20251128.3.md` → `summary20251128.3.md` for consistency

**Reconstructed Session 2 from git history:**
- Created `summary20251128.2.md` (2.8KB)
- Documented test cleanup work: 44 errors → 0, demo app removal, git setup fixes
- Captured LLM model constant updates

**Verified Session 4:**
- No session 4 exists (gap in numbering between sessions 3 and 5)

**Split Session 6 (Option B):**
- Extracted implementation plan to `design/multi_repo_workflow_implementation.md` (520 lines, 16KB)
- Reduced summary to concise format (143 lines, 5KB)
- Maintained full traceability via references

## Deliverables

### Created Files
1. `Summary/summary20251128.7.md` - This session summary
2. `Summary/summary20251128.2.md` - Reconstructed from git history
3. `design/multi_repo_workflow_implementation.md` - Extracted from session 6

### Modified Files
1. `.gitignore` - Added `artifacts/` directory
2. `Summary/summary20251128.6.md` - Reduced from 567 to 143 lines

### Renamed Files
1. `Summary/20251128.3.md` → `Summary/summary20251128.3.md`

## Session Inventory for 20251128

| Session | Focus | Key Outcome |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Test improvements | 96.5% pass rate, brittle test guide |
| 2 | Test cleanup | Fixed 44 errors, 79 failures remain |
| 3 | CI/CD & security | GitHub Actions, MkDocs, FastAOI verification |
| 4 | *(no session)* | Gap in numbering |
| 5 | Branch cleanup | Analyzed unmerged branches |
| 6 | Multi-repo planning | Created implementation roadmap |
| 7 | Summary organization | Cleanup and documentation |

## Outcome

✅ **All session summaries organized and complete**
- 6 sessions documented (no session 4)
- Consistent naming convention
- Session 6 split into summary + design doc
- Ready for future reference

✅ **Repository cleaned up**
- Artifacts excluded from git tracking
- All changes committed and pushed
- Synced with main branch

## Git Summary
**Commits:**
1. `89bb537` - Add summary and ignore artifacts directory
2. `16d1cc6` - Organize session summaries and extract design doc

**Changes:**
- 4 files changed, 691 insertions(+), 518 deletions(-)
- 2 new files, 1 renamed, 1 modified, 1 gitignore update

## Key Context for Next Session

**Test Suite Status (from Session 1-2):**
- Unit tests: 600/622 passing (96.5%)
- 22 failures remaining (markdown renderer, cycle tracker, orchestrator)
- E2E tests: 30/60 passing with mock LLM (50%)

**Available Next Steps:**
1. Fix remaining 22 unit test failures
2. Improve E2E mock response schemas (Design/Code/Test agents)
3. Implement multi-repo workflow (from design/multi_repo_workflow_implementation.md)
4. Address test coverage gap (39% → 80% target)
