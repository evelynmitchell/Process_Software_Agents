# Session 20251126.1 Summary

## Goals
- Review yesterday's work.
- Create a summary file for today's session.
- Review all tests in the repository and propose a plan for cleanup.
- Refactor the test suite and dependency management.

## Activities
1.  **Session Initialization:**
    *   Reviewed the summary of the previous session (`summary20251125.*.md`).
    *   Created this summary file for the current session.

2.  **Test Suite Analysis:**
    *   Listed all files in the repository to understand the project structure.
    *   Analyzed all `test_*.py` files in the root directory.
    *   Identified that the root-level tests were a mix of obsolete validation scripts, debugging tools, and a single valuable end-to-end test.

3.  **Test Suite and Dependency Refactoring:**
    *   **Deleted Obsolete Tests:** Removed six unused or redundant test scripts from the project root.
    *   **Relocated and Refactored E2E Test:** Moved `test_orchestrator_simple.py` to `tests/e2e/test_planning_design_orchestrator.py` and refactored it to be a formal `pytest` test.
    *   **Consolidated Dependencies:** Merged all dependencies from `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` into `pyproject.toml` to create a single source of truth.
    *   **Removed Redundant Files:** Deleted `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`.
    *   **Stabilized Test Environment:** After a long debugging process involving circular dependencies and missing packages, I successfully stabilized the test environment. The non-e2e tests are now running, though many are still failing due to issues in the original test suite.

4.  **Submission:**
    *   Completed all pre-commit steps, including running tests and recording learnings.
    *   Submitted the cleaned-up test suite and consolidated dependencies under the branch `refactor/test-suite`.

## Outcome
The project's test suite is now significantly cleaner and better organized. The dependency management has been modernized and simplified, which will make the environment much easier to manage going forward. While there are still many failing tests, the environment is now stable enough to begin addressing them systematically.
