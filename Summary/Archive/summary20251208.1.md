# Session Summary - 2025-12-08 Session 1

---

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

---

## Completeness Checklist

### Required (Claude fills)
- [x] Metadata complete (date, session#, commits, status)
- [x] Objective is one clear sentence
- [x] Work completed has concrete deliverables
- [x] Files changed table is accurate
- [x] End commit hash updated
- [x] Status updated to Complete/Blocked

### Required (Human fills)
- [ ] Previous session outcome assessed (or "N/A" if first)
- [ ] Interventions logged (or "none" noted)
- [ ] Rating provided (1-5)

### Optional but Valuable
- [ ] What worked / didn't work filled in
- [ ] Technical notes for future sessions
- [ ] Next session priorities listed

**Completeness Score:** ___/9 required, ___/3 optional

## Metadata
- **Date:** 2025-12-08
- **Session:** 1 (of day)
- **Start Commit:** 909eca2 (main, clean)
- **End Commit:** [this commit]
- **Status:** Complete

---

## Objective
Context sync and data audit to assess whether session summaries are consistent enough for process mining, then design a template that captures collaboration quality and effective work rate.

---

## Work Completed

- Reviewed weekly reflection (20251206) and recent session summaries
- Conducted data audit of 10 session summaries across Nov 11 - Dec 6
- Analyzed field consistency: date (100%), session# (90%), objective (90%), timing (40%)
- Correlated summaries with git commits - strong match
- Discussed north star metrics: rejected "interventions per task" alone, adopted "effective work rate"
- Created standardized session template with:
  - Previous session outcome tracking
  - Intervention logging
  - Completeness checklist
  - North star metric definition

## Files Changed

| File | Change Type | Lines |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `Summary/summary20251208.1.md` | created | ~120 |
| `Summary/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md` | created | ~120 |

## Data Audit Findings

### Field Presence (10 samples)

| Field | Present | Extractable? |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Date | 100% | Yes (filename) |
| Session # | 90% | Yes (filename) |
| Objective | 90% | Mostly |
| Files Modified | 80% | Partially |
| Duration/Timing | **40%** | No - too sparse |
| Outcome Status | 70% | Unreliable |

### Key Insight
Summaries captured *what Claude did* but not *whether the work was right* or *how the collaboration felt*. Git timestamps are more reliable than written duration notes.

## Collaboration Assessment

### Previous Session Outcome
[Human fills in at START of session - how did last session's work hold up?]

**Last Session:** 2025-12-06 Session 1 (weekly reflection + strategic discussion)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [ ] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**If not fully used, why?**
- [ ] Wrong approach - solved the wrong problem
- [ ] Incomplete - missed requirements
- [ ] Quality issues - bugs, errors discovered later
- [ ] Changed requirements - needs evolved
- [ ] Other: ___

**Rating:** /5

**Notes:**

---

## Technical Notes

- 100+ historical session summaries exist but format varies significantly
- Git correlation is strong - commit messages match summary content
- New template captures both lagging (previous outcome) and leading (interventions) indicators
- "Effective work rate" requires retrospective assessment - can only measure after time passes

---

## Open Questions (for future sessions)

- **Trunk/branch/twig problem:** How to weight work by significance? Metric may reward safe twig work over risky trunk work.
- **Project phase context:** Greenfield vs Growing vs Mature vs Migration changes what "good work" means. Need project-level template?
- **Research needed:** How do other teams solve significance weighting? (DORA, technical debt research, value stream mapping)

---

## Next Session

- Consider drafting project-level template (phase, trunk areas, success criteria)
- Optionally: build simple parser for historical data (date, session#, objective)
- Continue using new template to gather baseline data
