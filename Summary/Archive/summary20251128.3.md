# Session Summary: 2025-11-28 Session 3

## Overview
This session focused on repository hygiene, security verification, and implementing continuous integration/documentation infrastructure. The work included investigating FastAOI files and establishing GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, linting, and documentation publishing.

## 1. FastAOI Investigation
Conducted a comprehensive search across the entire repository to identify any FastAOI-related files, dependencies, or references.

### Search Coverage
*   **Filename searches**: Checked for `*FastAOI*`, `*fastaoi*`, `*fast_aoi*` patterns
*   **Content searches**: Searched for `FastAOI`, `fast.?aoi` (regex), and `AOI` across all files
*   **Dependencies**: Reviewed `pyproject.toml` and all `requirements.txt` files in artifacts
*   **Git history**: Checked commit messages and deleted files for any AOI references
*   **Configuration files**: Examined `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and other config files

### Results
*   **✅ No FastAOI files found**: Zero matches in filenames
*   **✅ No FastAOI dependencies**: All package dependencies are legitimate (FastAPI, pytest, etc.)
*   **✅ No content references**: No mentions of FastAOI in any codebase files
*   **✅ Clean git history**: No commits or deleted files related to FastAOI
*   **✅ FastAPI confusion resolved**: 574 occurrences of "FastAPI" found across 121 files - this is the legitimate web framework used by the project

### Files Examined
*   Main dependency file: `/pyproject.toml`
*   Artifact requirements: `artifacts/TEST-001/`, `TSP-FIB-001/`, `TSP-APPROVAL-001/`, `HW-001/`
*   Configuration: `.gitignore`, `README.md`
*   Test directories and documentation

## 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup
Implemented comprehensive continuous integration and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions, uv package manager, and modern Python tooling.

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
*   **Test Job**:
    - Runs pytest with pytest-cov for code coverage
    - 80% coverage requirement enforced
    - Python 3.12 with uv for fast dependency installation
    - Codecov integration for coverage reporting
*   **Lint Job**:
    - Black for code formatting validation
    - isort for import sorting
    - Ruff for fast, modern Python linting
    - Pylint for static code analysis (8.0+ score)
    - mypy for type checking
*   **Security Job**:
    - Bandit security linter for vulnerability detection
    - Safety checks for known dependency vulnerabilities

### Documentation Workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)
*   **Build Job**:
    - MkDocs with Material theme
    - mkdocstrings for automatic API documentation
    - Mermaid diagram support
    - Validates documentation structure
*   **Deploy Job**:
    - Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages on main/master push
    - Documentation site: `https://evelynmitchell.github.io/Process_Software_Agents/`

### MkDocs Configuration (`mkdocs.yml`)
*   Material theme with light/dark mode toggle
*   Comprehensive navigation structure:
    - Getting Started guides
    - API and Agent references
    - User stories (Manager, Developer, PM)
    - Requirements and UI designs
    - Architecture decisions
    - Testing documentation
*   Features: search, code highlighting, emoji support, table of contents
*   API documentation integration via mkdocstrings

### Configuration Updates (`pyproject.toml`)
*   Added dev dependencies:
    - `ruff>=0.1.0` - Modern fast linter
    - `pylint>=3.0.0` - Static analysis
    - `mkdocs-material>=9.5.0` - Documentation theme
    - `mkdocstrings[python]>=0.24.0` - API doc generation
*   Configured Ruff linting rules:
    - Line length: 88 (Black-compatible)
    - Target: Python 3.12
    - Enabled: pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, bugbear, comprehensions, pyupgrade
    - Per-file ignores for tests and `__init__.py`

### Supporting Documentation
*   Created `.github/workflows/README.md` with comprehensive workflow documentation
*   Created `docs/index.md` from project README for documentation homepage
*   Included local development commands and badge configurations

## Key Decisions
*   **Repository Status**: Confirmed the codebase is completely clean of FastAOI references
*   **Testing Artifacts**: All testing dependencies are properly separated and legitimate
*   **Security Verification**: No suspicious packages or dependencies identified
*   **CI/CD Strategy**: Use GitHub Actions with uv for fast, reliable automated testing and deployment
*   **Linting Tools**: Adopt Ruff as primary linter alongside Black, isort, and Pylint for comprehensive code quality
*   **Documentation Platform**: MkDocs with Material theme for professional, searchable documentation site
*   **Coverage Threshold**: Maintain 80% test coverage requirement enforced by CI
*   **Python Version**: Standardize on Python 3.12 across all workflows and tooling
