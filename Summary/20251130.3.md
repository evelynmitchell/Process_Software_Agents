# Session 20251130.3 Summary

**Date:** November 30, 2025
**Session ID:** 20251130.3
**Branch:** claude/langfuse-probe-analysis
**Topic:** Langfuse Tagging for PROBE Analysis

## Goals
- Write a report on tagging Langfuse entries to enable PROBE-style analysis across multiple tasks, projects, and people/GitHub accounts.
- Investigate the codebase to see if the current defect tagging aligns with PROBE methodologies (PSP/TSP).

## Context
- The user is interested in using the ASP platform for PROBE analysis (Performance and Reliability Optimization with Better Estimation / Proxy Based Estimation).
- This requires granular data tracking (defects, time, phases) associated with specific contexts (User, Project, Task).

## Activities
- Explored `src/asp/telemetry/telemetry.py` to understand current tagging capabilities.
- Analyzed gaps between current implementation and PROBE requirements (PSP/TSP standards).
- Created a comprehensive report detailing the tagging strategy.

## Outcomes
- [x] Report created: `docs/reports/langfuse_probe_tagging_analysis.md`.
    - Identified gaps in Project and User context tracking.
    - Proposed standardized tagging scheme (`project:<id>`, `user:<id>`).
    - Recommended PSP Standard Defect Type Taxonomy (10-100).
