# Session Summary - 2025-12-09 Session 5

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## Completeness Checklist

Before closing the session, verify:

### Required (Claude fills)

- [ ] End commit hash updated
- [ ] Status updated to Complete/Blocked

### Required (Human fills)
- [ ] Previous session outcome assessed (or "N/A" if first)
- [ ] Interventions logged (or "none" noted)
- [ ] Rating provided (1-5)

### Optional but Valuable
- [ ] What worked / didn't work filled in

---

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-09 Session 4 (Phase 2 HITL approval workflow)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [ ] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

## Work Completed

### Inter-Container HITL Integration Testing (Done)

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Build asp-webui container | Done |
| Build asp-agent-runner container | Done |
| Test agent-runner writes approval request to DB | Done |
| Test webui reads pending requests | Done |
| Test webui submits decision to DB | Done |
| Test agent-runner detects decision | Done |
| Verify web UI renders approvals page | Done |

**Test Flow Verified:**
1. Agent-runner container creates approval request in shared SQLite database
2. WebUI container reads pending requests from same database
3. WebUI container submits decision (approved/rejected)
4. Agent-runner container detects decision via polling
5. Web UI at `/manager/approvals` renders correctly with pending and history

### Issue Discovered and Fixed

**Problem:** SQLite database file permissions prevented containers from writing.
- Containers run as non-root user `asp` (uid 999)
- Host database owned by `codespace` user with 644 permissions
- Agent-runner got `sqlite3.OperationalError: attempt to write a readonly database`

**Fix:** `chmod 666 ./data/asp_telemetry.db`

**Documentation:** Added note to `docker-compose.webui.yml` header explaining the permission requirement.

### Housekeeping

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Rename SESSION_TEMPLATE.md to session_template.md | Done |
| Run database migration 007 | Done |

---

## Files Changed

| File | Change Type | Lines |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `Summary/summary20251209.5.md` | created | ~150 |
| `Summary/session_template.md` | renamed | 0 (was SESSION_TEMPLATE.md) |
| `docker-compose.webui.yml` | modified | +5 |

---

## Collaboration Assessment

### Interventions During This Session

| When | What Happened | Type |
|------|---------------|------|
| Template search | Human noted template name is uppercase, asked to rename | suggestion |
| Testing goal | Human asked "What is the goal of this testing?" when I was testing locally | clarification |
| Container testing | Human pointed out "The name of the testing is inter-container" | redirect |

**Intervention Count:** 3

### Session Rating

**Rating:** /5

**Notes:**

## Technical Notes

- SQLite file permissions are critical for inter-container communication. Database must be writable by container user (uid 999). Use `chmod 666` or initialize with proper ownership.
- The HITL polling approach (5s interval) works well for the use case - no need for WebSocket complexity.
- Docker Compose shared volume mount (`./data:/app/data`) enables both containers to access same SQLite file.
- Test data remains in database after testing - may want cleanup script for production.

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Push changes to origin** - Session 4 and 5 changes need to be pushed
2. **Create asp.cli module** - Command-line interface for agent task execution (from Session 1 priorities)
3. **End-to-end pipeline test** - Run actual agent pipeline with HITL gate in containers
