# Session 20251128.5 Summary

## Goals
- Sort through and clean up git branches in the repository
- Remove merged branches to reduce clutter
- Organize remaining branches for future work

## Activities
1.  **Branch Analysis:**
    *   Fetched all local and remote branches to assess the current state
    *   Identified branches that were already merged into main
    *   Categorized branches as either merged (safe to delete) or unmerged (requiring review)

2.  **Branch Cleanup:**
    *   **Identified Merged Branches:** Found 5 branches merged into main:
        - `claude/cleanup-branches-01TQ3a8GzTYCrpjiUeoHmbDk`
        - `copilot/sub-pr-49`
        - `docs/ui-requirements-1`
        - `docs/ui-sketches`
        - `docs/user-stories`
    *   **Permission Limitations:** Encountered HTTP 403 errors when attempting to delete non-claude branches due to session permissions
    *   **User Cleanup:** User deleted the merged branches manually via GitHub or local credentials
    *   **Remote Pruning:** Successfully pruned deleted remote tracking references

3.  **Branch Organization:**
    *   **Created Remote Branch:** Pushed current working branch `claude/cleanup-branches-01TQ3a8GzTYCrpjiUeoHmbDk` to origin with tracking
    *   **Identified Remaining Work:** Documented 4 unmerged branches requiring future review:
        - `claude/create-daily-summary-01AqaoCdzoALjV4UYtK6eFis`
        - `claude/create-summary-file-01T8kW3P3fQKuwjyCwNz2x9Z`
        - `claude/fix-failing-tests-013NQgHH35f8MGyQq9wEJNLL`
        - `docs/ui-requirements`

4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Created this session summary file following the established format
    *   Documented pending tasks for future sessions (local branch cleanup, unmerged branch review)

## Outcome
The repository's branch structure is now significantly cleaner, with all merged branches removed from remote. The current working branch has been properly pushed and tracked. Four unmerged branches remain for future evaluation, and local tracking branches need cleanup in the next session. A clear path forward has been established for completing the branch maintenance work.

## Security Note
GitHub Dependabot flagged 1 moderate security vulnerability (alert #10) - requires separate review.
