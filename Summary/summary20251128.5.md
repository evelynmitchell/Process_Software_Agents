# Session 20251128.5 Summary

## Goals
- Sort through and clean up git branches in the repository
- Remove merged branches to reduce clutter
- Organize remaining branches for future work

## Activities
1.  **Branch Analysis:**
    *   Fetched all local and remote branches to assess the current state
    *   Identified branches that were already merged into main
    *   Categorized branches as either merged (safe to delete) or unmerged (requiring review)

2.  **Branch Cleanup:**
    *   **Identified Merged Branches:** Found 5 branches merged into main:
        - `claude/cleanup-branches-01TQ3a8GzTYCrpjiUeoHmbDk`
        - `copilot/sub-pr-49`
        - `docs/ui-requirements-1`
        - `docs/ui-sketches`
        - `docs/user-stories`
    *   **Permission Limitations:** Encountered HTTP 403 errors when attempting to delete non-claude branches due to session permissions
    *   **User Cleanup:** User deleted the merged branches manually via GitHub or local credentials
    *   **Remote Pruning:** Successfully pruned deleted remote tracking references

3.  **Branch Organization:**
    *   **Created Remote Branch:** Pushed current working branch `claude/cleanup-branches-01TQ3a8GzTYCrpjiUeoHmbDk` to origin with tracking
    *   **Identified Remaining Work:** Documented 4 unmerged branches requiring future review:
        - `claude/create-daily-summary-01AqaoCdzoALjV4UYtK6eFis`
        - `claude/create-summary-file-01T8kW3P3fQKuwjyCwNz2x9Z`
        - `claude/fix-failing-tests-013NQgHH35f8MGyQq9wEJNLL`
        - `docs/ui-requirements`

4.  **Documentation:**
    *   Created this session summary file following the established format
    *   Documented pending tasks for future sessions (local branch cleanup, unmerged branch review)

5.  **Unmerged Branch Review:**
    *   **Branch 1: claude/create-daily-summary-01AqaoCdzoALjV4UYtK6eFis (Session 1)**
        - 127 commits ahead of main
        - Last updated: Nov 28, 2025 17:10
        - Contains: Session summary, brittle tests documentation (307 lines), test improvements, git utilities enhancements
        - Test pass rate: 96.5%
        - Recommendation: High value - merge after Session 3
    *   **Branch 2: claude/create-summary-file-01T8kW3P3fQKuwjyCwNz2x9Z (Session 3)**
        - 3 commits ahead of main
        - Last updated: Nov 28, 2025 19:10
        - Contains: CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions), MkDocs documentation infrastructure, session summary
        - Files: ci.yml, docs.yml, docs/index.md (640 lines), mkdocs.yml
        - Recommendation: High value - merge first (cleanest, infrastructure-focused)
    *   **Branch 3: claude/fix-failing-tests-013NQgHH35f8MGyQq9wEJNLL (Session 2)**
        - 78 commits ahead of main
        - Last updated: Nov 28, 2025 17:42
        - Contains: Test suite cleanup, removed demo app tests (350 lines), fixed git signing issues
        - Test status: Fixed 44 errors and 14 failed tests, 79 failures remaining
        - Recommendation: Medium value - review carefully before merging
    *   **Branch 4: docs/ui-requirements (Nov 27 session)**
        - 1 commit ahead of main
        - Last updated: Nov 28, 2025 15:44
        - Contains: Only session summary file (27 lines)
        - Recommendation: Low priority - simple merge

## Outcome
The repository's branch structure is now significantly cleaner, with all merged branches removed from remote. The current working branch has been properly pushed and tracked.

**Unmerged Branches Analysis**: Completed detailed review of 4 unmerged branches totaling 209 commits. Two branches contain high-value infrastructure and testing improvements ready for merge. One branch requires careful review due to remaining test failures. One branch contains only documentation.

**Recommended Merge Order**:
1. Session 3 (CI/CD + docs infrastructure)
2. Session 1 (test improvements + documentation)
3. Session 2 (test cleanup - review 79 remaining failures first)
4. Nov 27 docs (trivial merge)

Local tracking branches still need cleanup in next session.

## Security Note
GitHub Dependabot flagged 1 moderate security vulnerability (alert #10) - requires separate review.
