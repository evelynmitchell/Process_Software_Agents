# Session Summary - 2025-12-15 Session 4

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

- Updated ADR 009 Phase 4 with bidirectional GitHub sync:
  - New architecture diagram showing import/export/conflict resolution
  - `import_from_github()` function to pull GitHub issues into Beads
  - `sync_bidirectional()` function for full two-way sync
  - Three conflict resolution strategies: local-wins, remote-wins, newest-wins
  - New CLI commands: `asp beads push`, `asp beads pull`, `asp beads sync`
  - Extended `BeadsConfig` with import/export options

## Technical Notes

### GitHub ↔ Beads Sync Design

**Link tracking:** GitHub issues are linked to Beads via labels:
- When imported: Beads issue gets `gh-{number}` label
- When exported: GitHub issue gets `beads` label and `[bd-xxx]` in title

**Conflict detection:** Simple title comparison - if titles differ, it's a conflict.

**CLI naming convention:** Uses git-like terminology:
- `push` = export local to remote (Beads → GitHub)
- `pull` = import remote to local (GitHub → Beads)
- `sync` = bidirectional

---

## Next Session Priorities

- Implement Phase 1 of ADR 009: Manual CLI trigger (`asp beads process`)
- Add tests for CLI commands
- Consider implementing Phase 4 import function for immediate use
