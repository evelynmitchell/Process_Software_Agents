# Session Summary - 2025-12-10 Session 12

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Technical Notes

### git_commit_artifact Function Signature
The correct signature is:
```python
git_commit_artifact(
    task_id: str,
    agent_name: str,       # NOT artifact_type
    artifact_files: list[str],  # NOT file_paths
    status: str | None = None,
    path: str | None = None,
)
```

### Pylint + Pydantic False Positives
Pylint doesn't understand Pydantic model attributes and reports `E1101: no-member` for valid field accesses. Use `# pylint: disable=no-member` to suppress.

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Run full E2E stability test** - Verify pipeline with all fixes
2. **Continue HITL integration testing** - End-to-end approval flow in containers
3. **Address Test Agent defects** - 66/68 tests passed, 2 defects remain
