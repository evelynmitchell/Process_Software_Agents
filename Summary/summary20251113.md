**Yesterday's Stats:** 2,220 lines written (11 files created/updated), 9 git commits

## Today's Focus - November 13, 2025

### Morning Status
- **Langfuse Secrets Configured:** User has added Langfuse API keys to GitHub Codespaces Secrets ✅
- **Observability Platform:** Now fully ready for integration 🟢
- **Next Priority:** Begin agent implementation with telemetry infrastructure

### Immediate Next Steps

Based on PRD Section 7 and completed infrastructure, ready to begin agent implementation:

#### 1. Verify Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify Langfuse secrets are accessible as environment variables
- [ ] Test basic Langfuse connection from Python
- [ ] Run test suite to confirm environment (`uv run pytest`)

#### 2. Create Telemetry Infrastructure
- [ ] Install/verify Langfuse Python SDK
- [ ] Create telemetry utility module (`src/asp/utils/telemetry.py`)
- [ ] Implement `@track_agent_cost` decorator
- [ ] Implement `@log_defect` decorator
- [ ] Create database logging helpers (SQLite integration)
- [ ] Write unit tests for telemetry decorators

#### 3. Create Data Models
- [ ] Create Pydantic models for core entities (`src/asp/models/`)
  - `AgentCostVector` (FR-010)
  - `DefectLog` (FR-011)
  - `TaskMetadata` (FR-012)
  - `BootstrapMetrics` (FR-020)
- [ ] Add SQLAlchemy ORM models if needed
- [ ] Write validation tests for data models

#### 4. Implement First Agent Stub (Planning Agent)
- [ ] Create `src/asp/agents/planning_agent.py`
- [ ] Implement basic Task Decomposition prompt (FR-001)
- [ ] Implement Semantic Complexity scoring (Section 13.1 C1 formula)
- [ ] Add telemetry instrumentation (log to Langfuse + SQLite)
- [ ] Write unit tests for Planning Agent
- [ ] Create example usage script

#### 5. End-to-End Test
- [ ] Run Planning Agent on sample task
- [ ] Verify telemetry appears in Langfuse dashboard
- [ ] Verify cost data written to SQLite database
- [ ] Document any issues or learnings

### Phase 1 Success Criteria Tracking

From PRD Section 7, Phase 1 goals:
- **Logging Coverage:** 0/100% (target: 100% of agent executions logged)
- **Tasks Completed with Telemetry:** 0/30 (target: 30+ tasks)
- **Dashboard Accessible:** Langfuse dashboard ready ✅
- **Infrastructure Complete:** 75% (6/8 major items done)

### Questions to Resolve

1. Should we use Langfuse SDK decorators or build custom telemetry layer?
2. Do we need SQLAlchemy ORM or just use sqlite3 directly?
3. Which LLM provider to start with for Planning Agent (Anthropic Claude recommended in PRD)?

## Notes

### Environment Check
- Working directory: `/workspaces/Process_Software_Agents`
- Git branch: `main`
- Git status: Clean (as of start of day)
- Python version required: 3.12+
- Package manager: uv
- Database: `data/asp_telemetry.db`

### Key Files for Reference
- `Claude.md` - Development workflow and standards
- `PRD.md` - Complete product specification (v1.2)
- `README.md` - Project overview and Codespaces quick start
- `docs/database_schema_specification.md` - Database design details
- `docs/observability_platform_evaluation.md` - Langfuse selection rationale
- `docs/data_storage_decision.md` - SQLite vs PostgreSQL decision
- `docs/secrets_management_decision.md` - GitHub Codespaces Secrets decision
- `database/README.md` - Database setup instructions
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Development Workflow Reminders
1. Always use `uv run` for Python commands (automatic venv management)
2. Use 6-stage PSP workflow for all development
3. Create git commits with specific, descriptive messages
4. Update this summary file regularly as work progresses
5. Pre-commit hooks will auto-fix formatting (remember to `git add` and `--amend`)

### Langfuse Integration Notes
- Public Key: Available as `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable
- Secret Key: Available as `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- Host: Available as `LANGFUSE_HOST` environment variable
- Documentation: https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python
