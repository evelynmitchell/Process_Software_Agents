# Session Summary - 2025-12-23 Session 1

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Coverage gap** - Add tests to reach 75% threshold (need 3.58% more)
2. **LLMClient integration** - Wire ProviderRegistry into LLMClient (ADR 010 completion)
3. **Optional deps** - Add `allpairspy`, `hypothesis` to dev deps or skip tests
4. **Branch cleanup** - Delete merged feature branches
