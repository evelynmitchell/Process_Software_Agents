**Date:** November 30, 2025
**Session ID:** 20251130.7
**Branch:** claude/web-ui-stack-proposal
**Topic:** Proposal: Web UI Stack (No-NPM/WASM)

## Goals
- Write a detailed proposal for the Web UI technology stack.
- Constraints: Minimize JavaScript, avoid npm/node_modules, consider WASM.
- Focus: Ease of maintenance for Python developers, basis for ongoing improvement.

## Context
- The project currently uses FastAPI.
- The user is not a web developer and wants to avoid the complexity of modern frontend build chains (npm, webpack, etc.).

## Activities
- Created `docs/proposals/web_ui_stack.md`: A detailed proposal recommending **FastHTML** as the primary UI stack.
    - Evaluated options: FastHTML vs FastAPI+HTMX vs PyScript.
    - Justified FastHTML based on "Zero npm" and "Pythonic" requirements.
    - Outlined an implementation plan.

## Outcomes
- [x] Proposal created: `docs/proposals/web_ui_stack.md`.
