# Work Summary - November 12, 2025

## Current Project Status

### Phase 1 Infrastructure - COMPLETE ✅
As of November 11, 2025, all foundational infrastructure for the ASP Platform has been completed:

1. **Project Structure Initialized**
   - Full directory structure created (`src/asp/`, `tests/`, `database/`, `docs/`)
   - Python package initialized with `pyproject.toml`
   - 119 dependencies installed via `uv sync --all-extras`
   - Virtual environment created at `.venv/`

2. **Documentation Complete**
   - PRD v1.2 finalized with Bootstrap Learning Framework
   - Database schema specification completed (4 tables, 25+ indexes)
   - Observability platform evaluation completed (Langfuse selected)
   - PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and README.md created

3. **Database Schema Designed**
   - 4 core tables: agent_cost_vector, defect_log, task_metadata, bootstrap_metrics
   - SQL migration scripts created (001-004)
   - TimescaleDB optimization configured
   - Sample data scripts ready

4. **Technology Stack Finalized**
   - Langfuse selected for observability (self-hosted)
   - PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for database
   - Python 3.12+ with uv package manager
   - 7 agent architecture defined

### Key PRD Features (v1.2)
- **24 Functional Requirements** covering all 7 specialized agents
- **18 Non-Functional Requirements** for performance, security, scalability
- **5-Phase Implementation Roadmap** (12-month timeline)
- **Bootstrap Learning Framework** (Section 14) - 5 capabilities with graduation criteria
- **Implementation Considerations** (Section 13) - 10 critical concerns addressed
- **18 Risks** identified with mitigation strategies

### Bootstrap Learning Framework Highlights
- **B1:** PROBE-AI Estimation (10-20 tasks, MAPE < 20%)
- **B2:** Task Decomposition Quality (15-30 tasks, <10% correction rate)
- **B3:** Error-Prone Area Detection (30+ tasks, risk map generation)
- **B4:** Review Agent Effectiveness (20-40 reviews, TP >80%, FP <20%)
- **B5:** Defect Type Prediction (50+ tasks, 60% prediction accuracy)

## Today's Focus - November 12, 2025

### Immediate Next Steps

Based on PRD Section 7 (Implementation Roadmap) and yesterday's completion of infrastructure setup, the next logical steps are:

#### 1. Environment Setup & Validation
- [ ] Run `setup_codespace.sh` if in new codespace
- [ ] Verify all dependencies installed (`uv sync --all-extras`)
- [ ] Run test suite to confirm environment (`uv run pytest`)

#### 2. Deploy Database Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database (local or cloud)
- [ ] Create database: `asp_telemetry`
- [ ] Run migration scripts:
  - `001_create_tables.sql`
  - `002_create_indexes.sql`
  - `003_timescaledb_setup.sql` (if using TimescaleDB)
  - `004_sample_data.sql` (for testing)
- [ ] Verify schema with sample queries

#### 3. Set Up Observability Platform
- [ ] Create Langfuse Cloud account (free tier for prototyping)
- [ ] Generate API keys
- [ ] Test basic logging from Python
- [ ] Document connection setup in `.env.example`

#### 4. Implement First Agent Stub (Planning Agent)
- [ ] Create `src/asp/agents/planning_agent.py`
- [ ] Implement basic Task Decomposition prompt
- [ ] Implement Semantic Complexity scoring (Section 13.1 C1 formula)
- [ ] Add telemetry instrumentation (log to Langfuse)
- [ ] Write unit tests for Planning Agent

#### 5. Create Telemetry Decorators
- [ ] Implement `@track_agent_cost` decorator
- [ ] Implement `@log_defect` decorator
- [ ] Test logging to both Langfuse and PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create usage examples

### Phase 1 Success Criteria Tracking

From PRD Section 7, Phase 1 goals:
- **Logging Coverage:** 0/100% (target: 100% of agent executions logged)
- **Tasks Completed with Telemetry:** 0/30 (target: 30+ tasks)
- **Dashboard Accessible:** Not yet deployed

### Questions to Resolve Today

1. Should we use PostgreSQL locally or deploy to cloud (e.g., Railway, Supabase)?
2. Start with Langfuse Cloud or go directly to self-hosted?
3. Which agent to implement first: Planning or Design?
4. Should we create a simple CLI for testing agents before building full orchestration?

## Notes

### Environment Check
- Working directory: `/workspaces/Process_Software_Agents`
- Git branch: `main`
- Git status: Clean (as of start of day)
- Python version required: 3.12+
- Package manager: uv

### Key Files for Reference
- `Claude.md` - Development workflow and standards
- `PRD.md` - Complete product specification (v1.2)
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `docs/database_schema_specification.md` - Database design details
- `docs/observability_platform_evaluation.md` - Langfuse selection rationale
- `database/README.md` - Database setup instructions

### Development Workflow Reminders
1. Always use `uv run` for Python commands (automatic venv management)
2. Use 6-stage PSP workflow for all development
3. Create git commits with specific, descriptive messages
4. Update this summary file regularly as work progresses
5. Pre-commit hooks will auto-fix formatting (remember to `git add` and `--amend`)
