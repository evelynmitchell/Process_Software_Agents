## Today's Focus - November 12, 2025

### Immediate Next Steps

Based on PRD Section 7 (Implementation Roadmap) and yesterday's completion of infrastructure setup, the next logical steps are:

#### 1. Environment Setup & Validation
- [ ] Run `setup_codespace.sh` if in new codespace
- [ ] Verify all dependencies installed (`uv sync --all-extras`)
- [ ] Run test suite to confirm environment (`uv run pytest`)

#### 2. Deploy Database Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **DECISION: Use SQLite for Phase 1-3** (see `docs/data_storage_decision.md`)
- [x] Create SQLite-compatible schema scripts
- [x] Initialize SQLite database: `asp_telemetry.db`
- [x] Run migration scripts:
  - `create_tables.sql` (SQLite-compatible)
  - `create_indexes.sql`
  - `sample_data.sql` (for testing)
- [x] Verify schema with sample queries
- [x] Create Python initialization script (`scripts/init_database.py`)
- [x] Update `database/README.md` with SQLite documentation

#### 3. Set Up Observability Platform
- [ ] Create Langfuse Cloud account (free tier for prototyping)
- [ ] Generate API keys
- [ ] Test basic logging from Python
- [ ] Document connection setup in `.env.example`

#### 4. Implement First Agent Stub (Planning Agent)
- [ ] Create `src/asp/agents/planning_agent.py`
- [ ] Implement basic Task Decomposition prompt
- [ ] Implement Semantic Complexity scoring (Section 13.1 C1 formula)
- [ ] Add telemetry instrumentation (log to Langfuse)
- [ ] Write unit tests for Planning Agent

#### 5. Create Telemetry Decorators
- [ ] Implement `@track_agent_cost` decorator
- [ ] Implement `@log_defect` decorator
- [ ] Test logging to both Langfuse and SQLite
- [ ] Create usage examples

### Phase 1 Success Criteria Tracking

From PRD Section 7, Phase 1 goals:
- **Logging Coverage:** 0/100% (target: 100% of agent executions logged)
- **Tasks Completed with Telemetry:** 0/30 (target: 30+ tasks)
- **Dashboard Accessible:** Not yet deployed

### Questions Resolved Today

1. ✅ **Database Choice:** Use SQLite for Phase 1-3, migrate to PostgreSQL if needed (see `docs/data_storage_decision.md`)

### Questions to Resolve

1. Start with Langfuse Cloud or go directly to self-hosted?
2. Which agent to implement first: Planning or Design?
3. Should we create a simple CLI for testing agents before building full orchestration?

## Work Log

### Morning Session
- Created `summary20251112.md` to track today's progress
- Reviewed project status from November 11 work
- Identified next steps for Phase 1 implementation
- **Data Storage Decision:** Analyzed SQLite vs PostgreSQL options
  - Created comprehensive decision document (`docs/data_storage_decision.md`)

  - **Migration Path:** Clear criteria for when to switch to PostgreSQL
  - Updated summary and project documentation to reflect SQLite choice

### Afternoon Session
- **SQLite Database Implementation:** Created complete SQLite infrastructure
  - **Created 3 SQL schema files** in `database/sqlite/`:
    - `create_tables.sql` - 4 tables with SQLite-compatible syntax
      - Converted BIGSERIAL → INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
      - Converted TIMESTAMPTZ → TEXT (ISO 8601)
      - Converted JSONB → TEXT (JSON as text)
      - Converted Boolean → INTEGER (0/1)
      - Added CHECK constraints for enums and data validation
    - `create_indexes.sql` - 25+ performance indexes for common queries
    - `sample_data.sql` - Test data with 3 tasks, 29 agent cost records, 4 bootstrap metrics

  - **Created Python initialization script** (`scripts/init_database.py`)
    - CLI with argparse: `uv run python scripts/init_database.py`
    - Options: `--with-sample-data`, `--reset`, `--db-path`
    - Automatic schema validation (verifies all 4 tables created)
    - Statistics reporting (row counts, task summary)
    - User-friendly error handling and prompts
    - 260 lines of well-documented Python code

  - **Tested database initialization successfully:**
    - Created `asp_telemetry.db` (176 KB with sample data)
    - All 4 tables created with proper constraints
    - 25+ indexes created successfully
    - Sample queries verified working

  - **Updated documentation** (`database/README.md` v1.1):
    - SQLite as default Quick Start method
    - PostgreSQL moved to Advanced section
    - Updated query examples to work with both SQLite and PostgreSQL
    - Documented migration path from SQLite to PostgreSQL
    - Added SQLite-specific syntax notes

### Evening Session
- **Database File Location Decision:** Organized database storage
  - **Issue identified:** Database file was defaulting to project root, cluttering the directory
  - **Options considered:** 4 locations evaluated (root, database/, .data/, data/)
  - **Decision:** Use `data/asp_telemetry.db` directory structure
    - Separates runtime data from source code
    - Follows common conventions (like logs/, output/)
    - Extensible for future files (exports, backups)
    - Keeps project root clean

  - **Implementation:**
    - Created `data/` directory with `.gitkeep` file
    - Updated `scripts/init_database.py` default path
    - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `data/*` (except `.gitkeep`)
    - Moved existing database file from root to `data/`
    - Updated all documentation references
    - Added Addendum to `docs/data_storage_decision.md`

  - **Tested:** Database initialization script works perfectly with new path

- **Secrets Management Setup:** Configured secure API key management
  - **Context:** User created Langfuse account and needs to securely store API keys
  - **Options considered:** 4 approaches evaluated (.env file, encrypted git, Codespaces Secrets, cloud secret manager)
  - **Decision:** Use GitHub Codespaces Secrets
    - Native integration with Codespaces environment
    - Secrets auto-injected as environment variables
    - Persistent across rebuilds
    - Zero risk of git commits
    - Easy team sharing and key rotation

  - **Implementation:**
    - Created `docs/secrets_management_decision.md` (441 lines)
    - Created `.env.example` with all variables commented out
    - Documented setup process for team members
    - Security best practices and guidelines

  - **Required Secrets:**
    - `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_HOST`
    - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    - `DATABASE_URL`, config variables

- **README Comprehensive Update:** Documented Codespaces workflow
  - **Major rewrite of Quick Start section:**
    - Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended) - complete workflow
    - Secrets configuration table with links to dashboards
    - Step-by-step verification commands
    - Option 2: Local Development (updated for SQLite)

  - **Updated sections:**
    - Technology Stack: Added Codespaces, SQLite/PostgreSQL phased approach
    - Phase 1 Status: Accurate progress (5/8 items complete)
    - Documentation: Added Architecture Decisions subsection
    - Roadmap: Marked Phase 1 as "In Progress" with completion tracking
    - Key Features: Reorganized into Delivered/In Progress/Planned

  - **Impact:** New contributors can onboard in minutes with clear Codespaces workflow

### Blockers & Issues
- **Minor issue discovered:** Sample data SQL initially didn't insert defect_log records
  - Likely due to CHECK constraint validation or transaction handling
  - Manual insert test successful, verifying table structure is correct
  - Not blocking progress - sample data is for testing only

### Good Practices Learned
- **Decision Documentation:** Creating formal decision documents with rationale, alternatives considered, and validation criteria helps maintain project clarity
- **YAGNI Principle Applied:** Don't build infrastructure for problems we don't have yet (PostgreSQL complexity not needed in Phase 1-3)
- **Reversible Decisions:** Choosing SQLite with a clear migration path reduces risk while maintaining flexibility
- **Both SQL and Python:** Providing both raw SQL scripts and Python automation gives flexibility for different deployment scenarios
- **Database Abstraction:** SQLite and PostgreSQL schemas can coexist by designing for the lowest common denominator with documented differences
- **Test Data is Critical:** Sample data helps validate schema design and provides immediate feedback on query patterns
- **Iterative Refinement:** Even small organizational decisions (like file location) benefit from documentation and can be refined based on user feedback
- **Project Organization:** Separating runtime data (data/) from static code improves project clarity and follows established conventions
- **Security First:** Never commit secrets to git; use platform-native secret management (GitHub Codespaces Secrets)
- **Comment Out Defaults:** In .env.example, comment out all variables to force intentional configuration
- **README as Onboarding:** Clear Quick Start guides dramatically reduce contributor friction (Codespaces workflow vs local setup)

### Next Session Priorities
1. ✅ ~~Create SQLite-compatible database schema scripts~~ **COMPLETE**
2. ✅ ~~Initialize SQLite database and test with sample data~~ **COMPLETE**
3. ✅ ~~Set up Langfuse Cloud account~~ **COMPLETE** - Add secrets to GitHub Codespaces
