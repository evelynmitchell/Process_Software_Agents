# Session Summary - 2025-12-11 Session 1

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Technical Notes

### ADR 006 Status: Complete

All 5 phases of ADR 006 Repair Workflow Architecture have been implemented:

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Foundation - Execution Infrastructure | Complete |
| Phase 2 | Diagnostic Capability | Complete |
| Phase 3 | Repair Capability | Complete |
| Phase 4 | Orchestration | Complete |
| Phase 5 | Integration & CLI | Complete |

### Key Deliverables from ADR 006

1. **Execution Infrastructure**
   - SandboxExecutor with subprocess isolation
   - TestExecutor with pytest parsing
   - ExecutionResult, TestResult models

2. **Diagnostic System**
   - DiagnosticAgent for root cause analysis
   - DiagnosticReport with affected files and suggested fixes
   - Search-replace based code changes (not line numbers)

3. **Repair System**
   - RepairAgent for generating fixes
   - SurgicalEditor with fuzzy matching
   - RepairAttempt tracking with history

4. **Orchestration**
   - RepairOrchestrator with async repair loop
   - Confidence calculation with weighted scoring
   - HITL configuration with approval modes

5. **Integration**
   - CLI `repair` command
   - Integration tests for repair workflow
   - TSPExecutionResult with repair_result field

## Next Session Priorities

### Potential Next Steps (To Discuss)

1. **E2E Testing with Real LLM**
   - Create actual buggy calculator project
   - Run real repair workflow end-to-end
   - Validate full LLM integration

2. **Multi-Language Support** (ADR 006 Phase 6 - optional)
   - Jest result parser for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Go test result parser
   - Cargo test result parser for Rust

3. **Documentation & User Guide**
   - Update README with repair workflow usage
   - Create user guide for repair CLI
   - Document HITL configuration options

4. **New ADR/Feature**
   - What's the next major capability?
   - Code review agent improvements?
   - Additional orchestration patterns?

5. **Technical Debt**
   - Any cleanup from ADR 006 implementation?
   - Test coverage improvements?
   - Performance optimizations?
