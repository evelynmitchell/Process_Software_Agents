# Session Summary - 2025-12-11 Session 2

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Completeness Checklist

Before closing the session, verify:

- [x] Objective is one clear sentence
- [ ] Work completed has concrete deliverables
- [ ] Files changed table is accurate
- [ ] End commit hash updated
- [ ] Status updated to Complete/Blocked

### Required (Human fills)
- [ ] Previous session outcome assessed (or "N/A" if first)
- [ ] Interventions logged (or "none" noted)
- [ ] Rating provided (1-5)

### Optional but Valuable
- [ ] What worked / didn't work filled in

## Metadata
- **Date:** 2025-12-11
- **Session:** 2 (of day)
- **Start Commit:** 5661a0b (Update session 1 summary - complete)
- **End Commit:** [pending]
- **Status:** In Progress

## Objective

Discuss advanced testing strategies: combination testing, property-based testing (Hypothesis), and mutation testing.

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-11 Session 1 (Planning / ADR 007 draft)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**Summary of Session 1 work:**
- Drafted ADR 007: GitHub CLI Integration
- Marked multi-language parsers as out of scope
- Set next priority: implement ADR 007 for dogfooding

---

## Work Completed

- Created `design/testing_strategies.md` covering:
  - Combination testing (pairwise with allpairspy)
  - Design of Experiments (DoE) - full/fractional factorial, Taguchi, Latin Hypercube
  - Property-based testing (Hypothesis with compute budget profiles)
  - Mutation testing (mutmut for nightly runs)
  - Unit test evaluation rubric
  - Opt-in enablement via pytest markers

## Technical Notes

### Testing Strategy Discussion

#### 1. Combination Testing (Pairwise/Combinatorial)
- Tests interactions between parameters
- Reduces test explosion from full cartesian product
- Tools: `allpairspy`, `pict`

#### 2. Property-Based Testing (Hypothesis)
- Generates random inputs based on strategies
- Finds edge cases humans miss
- Shrinks failing cases to minimal examples
- Python: `hypothesis` library

#### 3. Mutation Testing
- Modifies code (mutants) to verify tests catch bugs
- Measures test suite effectiveness beyond coverage
- Tools: `mutmut`, `cosmic-ray`

### Discussion Notes

[To be filled in]
