# Session Summary - 2025-12-11 Session 6

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-11 Session 5 (ADR 007 Phase 1)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**Summary of Session 5 work:**
- Created `src/services/github_service.py` (~380 lines)
- Created tests for Phase 1 (29 tests)
- Implemented GitHubService with issue fetching, cloning, branch management

---

## Work Completed

1. **Added `push_branch()` to GitHubService** (~40 lines):
   - Pushes branch to origin with `-u` flag
   - Supports force push option
   - Proper error handling with GitHubServiceError

2. **Added `create_pr()` to GitHubService** (~60 lines):
   - Creates PR using `gh pr create`
   - Supports draft PRs and custom base branches
   - Retrieves PR details (number, URL) after creation
   - Fallback URL parsing if `gh pr view` fails

3. **Added `format_pr_body()` helper method** (~30 lines):
   - Formats PR body using template with issue linking
   - Includes test results, coverage, repair metrics

4. **Added `PR_BODY_TEMPLATE` constant** (~25 lines):
   - Standardized PR body format
   - "Fixes #N" linking for issue auto-close
   - Sections: Summary, Changes, Test Results, Repair Process

5. **Added 12 new tests for Phase 2**:
   - `TestPushBranch`: 3 tests (success, force, failure)
   - `TestCreatePR`: 5 tests (success, draft, custom base, failure, fallback)
   - `TestFormatPRBody`: 2 tests (basic, defaults)
   - `TestPRBodyTemplate`: 2 tests (sections, placeholders)

6. **Updated ADR 007** - marked Phase 2 as complete

## Technical Notes

### Phase 2 Design Decisions

1. **`push_branch()` uses `-u` flag:** Sets upstream tracking for easier subsequent pushes
2. **`create_pr()` fetches PR details:** Gets number/URL via `gh pr view --json` after creation for reliable data
3. **Fallback URL parsing:** If `gh pr view` fails, extracts PR number from create output URL
4. **`format_pr_body()` on service:** Keeps template formatting close to PR creation logic

### GitHubService now has complete PR workflow:
```python
service = GitHubService()
service.push_branch(repo_path, branch)
body = service.format_pr_body(issue, changes_summary="Fixed bug")
pr = service.create_pr(repo_path, title=f"Fix #{issue.number}", body=body, draft=True)
```

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **ADR 007 Phase 3:** Integration with RepairOrchestrator (`repair_from_issue()`)
2. **ADR 007 Phase 3:** Add `repair-issue` CLI command
3. **Integration tests** with a test repository
