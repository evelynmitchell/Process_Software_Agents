# Session Summary - 2025-12-16 Session 7

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.
