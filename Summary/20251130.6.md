# Session 20251130.6 Summary

**Date:** November 30, 2025
**Session ID:** 20251130.6
**Branch:** claude/container-profiles-design
**Topic:** Design Doc: Containerized User Profiles

## Goals
- Create a design document for running separate containers for each major user profile (Sarah, Alex, Jordan) plus an administrative container.
- Define how authentication, configuration, and workspace isolation will work in a containerized environment.

## Context
- The user wants to simulate or operate the ASP platform with distinct user personas.
- Containerization provides clean separation of environment (Git config, API keys, User ID) and runtime state.

## Activities
- Created `design/containerized_user_profiles.md` detailing:
    - Docker Compose architecture for multi-persona simulation.
    - Strategy for environment isolation (Git config, User ID).
    - Shared vs. isolated volume strategy.

## Outcomes
- [x] Design document created: `design/containerized_user_profiles.md`.
