# Session Summary - 2025-12-16 Session 9

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Collaboration Assessment

### Previous Session Outcome
[Human fills in at START of session - how did last session's work hold up?]

**Last Session:** 2025-12-16 Session 8

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [ ] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**If not fully used, why?**
- [ ] Wrong approach - solved the wrong problem
- [ ] Incomplete - missed requirements
- [ ] Quality issues - bugs, errors discovered later
- [ ] Changed requirements - needs evolved
- [ ] Other: ___

## Technical Notes

### Unit Test Best Practices Research

Source: [TestRail - How to Write Unit Tests](https://www.testrail.com/blog/how-to-write-unit-tests/)

#### Core Principles from TestRail

1. **Use a single strong assertion per test** - Makes it easier to identify root cause of failures and reduces noise in test reports

2. **Keep tests independent** - Each test should run in isolation and not depend on setup or outcome of another test

3. **Test behavior, not implementation details** - Focus on what the code should do rather than how it does it. Gives developers freedom to refactor without constantly updating tests.

4. **Avoid overly specific exception checks** - Don't rely on exact exception types; assert that an exception is thrown with matching message/context

#### Unit Testing in CI/CD
- First line of defense in CI/CD pipeline
- Catches defects early before integration/system/acceptance testing
- Parallel test execution reduces test time and provides faster feedback

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Superficial coverage** - High coverage doesn't mean meaningful coverage; must verify outcomes, not just execution
- **Over-reliance on implementation** - Tightly coupling tests to internal structure makes them fragile
- **Lack of real-world scenarios** - Basic-only testing leaves code vulnerable to edge cases
