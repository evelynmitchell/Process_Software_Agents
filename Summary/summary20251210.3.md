# Session Summary - 2025-12-10 Session 3

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-10 Session 2 (max_tokens fix for review agents)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [ ] Too early - not enough time to assess

[Human fills in]

**Summary of Session 2 work:**
- Increased max_tokens from 4096 to 8192 for all 12 review agents
- Verified fix with E2E test - agents using 6000-7000 tokens now complete without truncation
- Committed and pushed: 7bf9afb

## Work Completed

### 1. Update Telemetry Database Schema (Done)

Added 6 missing Code Review sub-agent roles to the `agent_role` CHECK constraint:
- `CodeQualityReview`
- `CodeSecurityReview`
- `BestPracticesReview`
- `TestCoverageReview`
- `CodePerformanceReview`
- `DocumentationReview`

**Files created/modified:**
- `database/migrations/008_add_code_review_agent_roles.sql` - New migration script
- `database/sqlite/create_tables.sql` - Updated for fresh installs
- Applied migration to `data/asp_telemetry.db`

### 2. Fix CI lxml Missing Dependency (Done)

Added `lxml>=6.0.2` to `[project.optional-dependencies] dev` in pyproject.toml.

The dependency was only in `[dependency-groups] dev` (uv-specific) but CI uses
`uv pip install --system -e ".[dev]"` which reads from `[project.optional-dependencies]`.

### Remaining Tasks

3. **Suppress git artifact warnings** - Handle `.gitignore` gracefully
4. **Fix unit test assertions** - Update tests for new error message format
