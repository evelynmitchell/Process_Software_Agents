# Session 20251130.2 Summary

**Date:** November 30, 2025
**Session ID:** 20251130.2
**Branch:** claude/ci-api-key-refactor
**Topic:** GitHub Actions Refactor for API Key Dependency

## Goals
- Refactor GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to check for API keys.
- Skip tests requiring API keys (marked `e2e` likely) if keys are missing.
- Ensure CI passes even without API keys.

## Context
- Session 20251130.1 completed the creation of a Colab notebook for the `nanoGPT` external repo workflow.
- The user noticed CI failures due to missing API keys in commits.

## Activities
- Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to include a conditional check for `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- Implemented logic to run `pytest -m "not e2e"` if keys are missing, effectively skipping tests that require authentication.

## Outcomes
- [x] Refactored CI workflow to skip API-dependent tests when secrets are unavailable.
- [x] Verified the logic using bash conditionals in the workflow step.
