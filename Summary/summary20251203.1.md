# Session Summary - 2025-12-03 Session 1

## Objective
Add OpenTelemetry tracing instrumentation to API and Web UI calls for reinforcement learning integration.

---

## Context

The goal is to add comprehensive OpenTelemetry tracing that captures (state, action, reward) triplets to support reinforcement learning systems like Agent Lightning. This instrumentation will enable:
- Observability of all API calls and web UI interactions
- Data collection for RL training on system usage patterns
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## OpenTelemetry Tracing Plan

### Target Areas for Instrumentation

1. **API Layer** (`src/asp/web/api.py`)
   - All database queries
   - External service calls
   - Data aggregation functions

2. **Web UI Routes**
   - `manager.py` - Manager dashboard endpoints
   - `developer.py` - Developer dashboard endpoints
   - `product.py` - Product manager endpoints
   - `main.py` - Core routes and health checks

3. **Data Layer** (`src/asp/web/data.py`)
   - Telemetry DB operations
   - Artifact file operations
   - Budget/settings persistence

4. **Orchestrators** (`src/asp/orchestrators/`)
   - TSP orchestration loops
   - Agent execution traces

### RL Triplet Structure (State, Action, Reward)

For Agent Lightning integration:
- **State**: Current system context (active agents, pending tasks, resource utilization)
- **Action**: User/agent operation being performed (API call, UI navigation, task execution)
- **Reward**: Outcome metrics (latency, success/failure, cost, tokens used)

---

## Completed Work

### 1. Reviewed Existing Telemetry Infrastructure

Discovered existing instrumentation:
- **Langfuse**: Already integrated for LLM observability (spans, events, usage)
- **SQLite** (`asp_telemetry.db`): Persistent storage with `agent_cost_vector` and `defect_log` tables
- **Decorators**: `@track_agent_cost` and `@log_defect` in `src/asp/telemetry/telemetry.py`

### 2. Documented Available State Information

Identified all data sources for RL state capture:
- Request context (task_id, description, requirements)
- Agent context (role, version, prompts)
- Pipeline context (phase, iteration, prior artifacts)
- System context (budget, approvals, active agents)
- Trace context (trace_id, parent_span, call depth)

### 3. Created ADR 003: OpenTelemetry RL Triplet Instrumentation

**File:** `design/ADR_003_opentelemetry_rl_triplet_instrumentation.md`

Key decisions:
- Use OpenTelemetry SDK with custom `rl.*` attributes
- Complement (not replace) existing Langfuse integration
- Export via OTLP to Agent Lightning
- Decorator-based instrumentation (`@rl_triplet`)

### 4. Refined Triplet Schema Based on Discussion

After discussion, evolved from rigid typed schemas to flexible model:

**Core Triplet Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class RLTriplet:
    triplet_id: str           # UUID
    sequence_id: str          # Links triplets for reward backpropagation
    sequence_index: int       # Order within sequence
    timestamp_utc: str

    state: dict               # Flexible - capture what's available
    action: dict              # Flexible - outcome of function call
    reward: float | None      # Continuous 0.0-1.0, initially None
```

**Design Decisions Made:**

| Decision | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| State typing | Flexible dict - we don't control it in detail |
| Reward range | Continuous 0.0 to 1.0 |
| Sequence scope | Configurable: agent, pipeline, session, custom |
| Reward assignment | Deferred - stored as None, assigned later |

**Sequence Scope Options:**

| Scope | sequence_id | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Agent | `{task_id}:{agent_role}` | Learn per-agent behavior |
| Pipeline | `{task_id}` | Learn end-to-end workflow |
| Session | `{session_id}` | Learn user interaction patterns |

**Reward Attribution Strategies:**

| Strategy | When | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Terminal | Pipeline end | Task succeeded → all triplets get 0.8 |
| Local | Immediately | Tool call succeeded → 1.0 |
| Informational | Immediately | LLM asked for clarification → 0.3 |

**Possible Reward Signals (not decided which to use):**
- Local: function success, validation pass, output non-empty
- Informational: clarification requested, retry triggered, feedback loop
- Terminal: tests pass, HITL approved, defects found, code merged

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|

## Next Steps (Implementation Plan from ADR)

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry dependencies to pyproject.toml
- [ ] Create `src/asp/telemetry/otel.py` configuration
- [ ] Create `src/asp/telemetry/rl_triplet.py` decorator

### Phase 2: Agent Instrumentation
- [ ] Add `@rl_triplet` to all 7 agents

### Phase 3: Web UI Instrumentation
- [ ] Auto-instrument FastAPI routes
- [ ] Add custom spans for key interactions

### Phase 4: Delayed Rewards
- [ ] Implement `assign_reward()` and `assign_sequence_reward()` APIs
- [ ] HITL approval callback
- [ ] Test result callback

### Phase 5: Agent Lightning Integration
- [ ] Configure OTLP exporter
- [ ] Validate format compatibility

## Open Questions (Acknowledged Unknowns)

1. **Reward strategy**: Which signals will we actually use? (Will experiment)
2. **Agent Lightning format**: Exact protocol/schema? (Need to verify)
3. **State content**: How much to capture? (Start truncated, iterate)
4. **Sampling**: 100% or sampled? (Start 100%, add if needed)

---

## Technical Notes

- OpenTelemetry Python SDK: `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk`
- OTLP exporter for Agent Lightning integration
- Auto-instrumentation available for FastAPI/Starlette
- Complements existing Langfuse (separate concerns)

---

## Status
Complete - ADR created, awaiting review and approval before implementation
