# Work Summary - November 11, 2025

## Tasks Completed

1. **Created Project Structure**
   - Created `Claude.md` with comprehensive development guidelines
   - Created `Summary/` folder for daily work tracking
   - Created `Summary/summary20251111.md` for today's work log

2. **Populated Claude.md**
   - Added complete guidance for working with this repository
   - Documented uv package manager usage
   - Documented 6-stage PSP workflow
   - Documented pre-commit hooks and git workflow for Claude Code
   - Documented testing philosophy and code quality standards

3. **Created Product Requirements Document (PRD.md)**
   - Analyzed PSPdoc.md containing Agentic Software Process (ASP) framework
   - Transformed academic/technical document into actionable PRD
   - Structured PRD with 12 major sections:
     - Executive Summary
     - Problem Statement (current state, why now)
     - Goals & Success Metrics
     - Target Users & Personas (3 personas)
     - Functional Requirements (19 requirements covering 8 agent roles)
     - Non-Functional Requirements (performance, scalability, security)
     - System Architecture (diagrams and tech stack recommendations)
     - 5-Phase Implementation Roadmap (12-month timeline)
     - Dependencies & Integrations
     - Risks & Mitigation (8 key risks identified)
     - Success Criteria & KPIs
     - Open Questions & Future Enhancements

4. **Enhanced PRD with Implementation Considerations (v1.1)**
   - Added Section 13 addressing 10 critical/medium/minor concerns:
     - **C1:** Semantic Complexity calculation formula (with weighted scoring algorithm)
     - **C2:** Bootstrap problem for PROBE-AI (added Phase 0.5 with human estimates)
     - **C3:** Context window management (semantic search + chunking strategy)
     - **C4:** Cost projections (added Appendix D with 3 scenarios: $270-$5,400/year)
     - **C5:** PIP rollback strategy (canary deployment + auto-rollback)
     - **C6:** HITL bottleneck mitigation (SLAs by priority: 4h-7d)
     - **C7:** Prompt version traceability (FR-22 for reproducibility)
     - **C8:** Staffing plan (2-4 engineers per phase, 0.85 FTE post-launch)
     - **C9:** Dashboard mockups (wireframes needed pre-Phase 1)
     - **C10:** Integration testing strategy (synthetic task suite)
   - Added 3 new functional requirements (FR-20, FR-21, FR-22)
   - Added 6 new risks to risk register (R9-R14)
   - Updated document version to 1.1

## Notes

### Key Concepts from ASP Framework

The Agentic Software Process (ASP) adapts the Personal Software Process (PSP) for autonomous AI agents:

- **Core Principle:** AI agents require formal process discipline (unlike Agile for humans)
- **7 Specialized Agents:** Planning, Design, Design Review, Coding, Code Review, Test, Postmortem
- **Quality Gates:** Mandatory review phases prevent "compounding errors"
- **PROBE-AI:** Linear regression estimation using historical agent performance data
- **Agent Cost Vector:** Multi-dimensional effort metric (latency, tokens, API cost, retries)
- **Semantic Complexity:** Replaces Lines of Code (LOC) as size metric
- **AI Defect Taxonomy:** 8 categories of agent failures (hallucination, prompt misinterpretation, etc.)
- **HITL (Human-in-the-Loop):** Required for Process Improvement Proposal (PIP) approval

### PRD Highlights

- **Incremental Rollout:** 5 phases over 12 months (Measurement → Estimation → Review → Orchestration → Self-Improvement)
- **Risk Mitigation:** Start with observability-only (Phase 1), gradually add autonomy
- **Success Metrics:** Estimation accuracy ±15%, defect density <0.10, phase yield >80%
- **Architecture:** Multi-agent orchestration with TSP Orchestrator as control plane
- **Tech Stack:** LangGraph/CrewAI for orchestration, Langfuse/AgentOps for telemetry

## Next Steps

1. **Review PRD with stakeholders**
   - Identify product owner and technical leads
   - Resolve open questions (Q1-Q5 in Section 11.1)
   - Get approval and sign-off

2. **Define Phase 1 implementation details**
   - Select observability platform (Langfuse vs. AgentOps vs. custom)
   - Design database schema for Agent Cost Vector and Defect Log
   - Create mockups for metrics dashboard

3. **Set up development environment**
   - Run `setup_codespace.sh` if available
   - Install dependencies via `uv sync --all-extras`
   - Configure pre-commit hooks

4. **Begin Phase 1 (ASP0 - Measurement) implementation**
   - Implement logging schemas
   - Integrate with existing development process
   - Deploy initial dashboard
