# Session Summary - 2025-12-15 Session 1

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-14 Session 1

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [ ] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**If not fully used, why?**
- [ ] Wrong approach - solved the wrong problem

- [ ] Quality issues - bugs, errors discovered later
- [ ] Changed requirements - needs evolved
- [ ] Other: ___

## Work Completed

- Created session summary file for 2025-12-15 Session 1
- Investigated test collection errors (3 modules failing to import)
- Confirmed dependencies already in `pyproject.toml` but not installed
- Installed all dev dependencies with `uv sync --all-extras`
- Installed Playwright Chromium browser
- Installed system dependencies for Playwright (libatk, libcups, libasound2t64, etc.)
- Verified all 1404 tests now collect successfully
- Reviewed PR #100 (Beads Integration and Kanban UI) - requested changes

### Dependencies Installed

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| pytest-asyncio | 1.3.0 | Async test support |
| playwright | 1.56.0 | E2E browser testing |
| allpairspy | 2.5.1 | Pairwise/combination testing |
| hypothesis | 6.148.7 | Property-based testing |

### PR #100 Review

Reviewed Jules-generated PR for Beads integration. Requested changes due to:
- PR description claims changes not in diff (planning_agent.py, tests, dependencies)
- Code issues: unused imports, deprecated `datetime.utcnow()`, print instead of logging
- Tailwind dynamic class issue in kanban.py
- Test data committed to repo

## Technical Notes

### Dev Dependency Installation
- Dependencies were already in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies]` dev section
- Use `uv sync --all-extras` to install all optional dependencies
- Playwright requires additional setup: `uv run playwright install chromium`
- Ubuntu 24.04 renamed `libasound2` to `libasound2t64`

### API Contract Tests
- Located in `tests/unit/test_docs/test_doc_examples.py`
- `TestKnownDocPatterns` class tests specific API patterns (e.g., correct function names)
- `TestCriticalExamples` class tests key documented examples work
- These catch documentation drift without executing arbitrary code

### Test Status
- 1404 tests collected
- Coverage at 26% (below 78% threshold)
- All import errors resolved

---

## Next Session Priorities

- Follow up on PR #100 after Jules addresses requested changes
- Consider running full test suite to identify any failures
- Address coverage gap if desired
- PR #95 was cherry-picked and closed per user
