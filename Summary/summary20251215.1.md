# Session Summary - 2025-12-15 Session 1

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## Completeness Checklist

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-14 Session 1

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [ ] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**If not fully used, why?**
- [ ] Wrong approach - solved the wrong problem
- [ ] Incomplete - missed requirements
- [ ] Quality issues - bugs, errors discovered later
- [ ] Changed requirements - needs evolved
- [ ] Other: ___

## Work Completed

- Created session summary file for 2025-12-15 Session 1
- Investigated test collection errors (3 modules failing to import)
- Confirmed dependencies already in `pyproject.toml` but not installed
- Installed all dev dependencies with `uv sync --all-extras`
- Installed Playwright Chromium browser
- Installed system dependencies for Playwright (libatk, libcups, libasound2t64, etc.)
- Verified all 1404 tests now collect successfully
- Reviewed PR number 100 (Beads Integration and Kanban UI) - requested changes

### Dependencies Installed

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| pytest-asyncio | 1.3.0 | Async test support |
| playwright | 1.56.0 | E2E browser testing |
| allpairspy | 2.5.1 | Pairwise/combination testing |
| hypothesis | 6.148.7 | Property-based testing |

### PR number 100 Review

Reviewed Jules-generated PR for Beads integration. Requested changes due to:
- PR description claims changes not in diff (planning_agent.py, tests, dependencies)
- Code issues: unused imports, deprecated `datetime.utcnow()`, print instead of logging
- Tailwind dynamic class issue in kanban.py
- Test data committed to repo

### luce_beach (Private Repo) Setup

Set up private repo tracking system and initialized luce_beach project:
- Created `.private_repos.yaml` (gitignored) for code name mapping
- Cloned private repo after re-authenticating with `repo` and `workflow` scopes
- Created PR number 1 in luce_beach: "Set up project structure with uv and CI"
  - Summary/ folder with session tracking
  - README with uv, Python 3.14t documentation
  - pyproject.toml configured for uv/hatch
  - GitHub Actions CI workflow (lint, type check, test)
  - src layout with option_screener package

## Technical Notes

### Working with Private Repos

**Setup (one-time per Codespace session):**
1. Codespace's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacks private repo access
2. Re-authenticate: `unset GITHUB_TOKEN && gh auth login --scopes repo,workflow --web`
3. The `workflow` scope is required to push GitHub Actions files

**Code Name System:**
- Private repos tracked via code names in session summaries (e.g., "luce_beach")
- Mapping stored in `.private_repos.yaml` (gitignored, never committed)
- Format:
  ```yaml
  code_name:
    path: /workspaces/repo-name
    description: Brief description
    notes: Tech stack, etc.
  ```

**PR Workflow for Private Repos:**
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/name`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push: `unset GITHUB_TOKEN && git push -u origin branch-name`
4. Create PR: `unset GITHUB_TOKEN && gh pr create`

**Session Summary References:**
- Use code names only in public summaries
- Example: "Created PR number 1 in luce_beach" (not the real repo name)

### Dev Dependency Installation
- Dependencies were already in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies]` dev section
- Use `uv sync --all-extras` to install all optional dependencies
- Playwright requires additional setup: `uv run playwright install chromium`
- Ubuntu 24.04 renamed `libasound2` to `libasound2t64`

### API Contract Tests
- Located in `tests/unit/test_docs/test_doc_examples.py`
- `TestKnownDocPatterns` class tests specific API patterns (e.g., correct function names)
- `TestCriticalExamples` class tests key documented examples work
- These catch documentation drift without executing arbitrary code

### Test Status
- 1404 tests collected
- Coverage at 26% (below 78% threshold)
- All import errors resolved

---

## Next Session Priorities

- Fix PR number 100 (Jules spinning) - apply requested changes directly
- Merge PR number 1 in luce_beach and implement core option screening logic
- Consider running full test suite to identify any failures
- Address coverage gap if desired
