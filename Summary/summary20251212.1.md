## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-11 Session 7 (ADR 007 Phase 4 Dogfooding)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**Summary of Session 7 work:**
- Created test issue #97 on GitHub for dogfooding
- Fixed TestExecutor API mismatch in repair_orchestrator.py
- Ran end-to-end dogfooding test with `repair-issue` CLI
- Identified real issues: test result parsing, agent suggesting non-existent files, telemetry tables missing

## Technical Notes

### ADR 007 GitHub CLI Integration - Current State

All 4 phases completed on 2025-12-11:

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Core GitHub Operations | Complete |
| 2 | PR Creation | Complete |
| 3 | RepairOrchestrator Integration | Complete |
| 4 | Dogfooding | Complete (issues identified) |

**Dogfooding Issues Found (from Session 7):**
1. Test result parsing returns -1/-1 when pytest has collection errors
2. Agent suggested non-existent files (surgical editor rejected correctly)
3. Telemetry tables missing (`no such table: agent_cost_vector`)

### Recent Commits (Dec 11-12)

```
8877c75 chore: add pre-commit to dev dependencies
eaf8275 style: fix black formatting
eee6a28 fix(repair): fix TestExecutor API mismatch + ADR 007 Phase 4 dogfooding
cbc141b feat(github): implement ADR 007 Phase 3 - RepairOrchestrator integration
ab5048d feat(github): implement ADR 007 Phase 2 - PR creation
```

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Fix dogfooding issues** from Session 7:
   - Improve test parser to handle pytest collection errors
   - Add better error feedback when agent suggests non-existent files

2. **ADR 008 Implementation** - Async Process Architecture (if ready)

3. **Create a real fixable bug** for proper repair-issue testing
