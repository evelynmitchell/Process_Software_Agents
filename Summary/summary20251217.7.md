# Session Summary - 2025-12-17 Session 7

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## Completeness Checklist

Before closing the session, verify:

### Required (Claude fills)
- [x] Metadata complete (date, session#, commits, status)
- [x] Objective is one clear sentence
- [x] Work completed has concrete deliverables
- [x] Files changed table is accurate
- [x] End commit hash updated
- [x] Status updated to Complete/Blocked

### Required (Human fills)
- [ ] Previous session outcome assessed (or "N/A" if first)
- [ ] Interventions logged (or "none" noted)
- [ ] Rating provided (1-5)

### Optional but Valuable
- [ ] What worked / didn't work filled in
- [x] Technical notes for future sessions
- [x] Next session priorities listed

**Completeness Score:** 6/6 required (Claude), ___/3 required (Human), 2/3 optional

---

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-17 Session 6 (summary20251217.6.md)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

---

## ADR 008 Implementation Status

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Async LLM Calls | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 | Async Agent Pattern | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3 | Async Services | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 4 | Async Orchestrators | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 5 | CLI Integration | ⏳ This Session |

### Phase 5 Targets
- Add `--async` flag to CLI commands
- Wrap `execute_async()` calls with `asyncio.run()`
- Update `run` and `repair` commands to support async mode

---

## Work Completed

### Phase 5: CLI Integration (Complete)

**Added `--async` flag to `run` command:**
- New argument: `--async` (dest=`use_async`)
- When enabled, uses `asyncio.run(orchestrator.execute_async())`
- Without flag, uses sync `orchestrator.execute()` (backward compatible)
- Logs mode: "ASYNC" or "SYNC" for visibility

**Updated help text:**
- Added example: `python -m asp.cli run --task-id TASK-001 --description "Add user auth" --async`

**Note:** `repair` and `repair-issue` commands already use `asyncio.run()` internally.

## Technical Notes

### ADR 008 Complete!
| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1: Async LLM Calls | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2: Async Agent Pattern | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3: Async Services | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 4: Async Orchestrators | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 5: CLI Integration | ✅ Complete (this session) |

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Sync mode (default, backward compatible)
python -m asp.cli run --task-id TASK-001 --description "Add feature"

# Async mode (ADR 008)
python -m asp.cli run --task-id TASK-001 --description "Add feature" --async
```

### Implementation Details
- `--async` flag stored as `use_async` (since `async` is Python keyword)
- Uses `asyncio.run()` to run `execute_async()` in sync context
- Repair commands already used asyncio.run() internally

---

## Next Session Priorities

- ADR 008 complete - consider documentation updates
- Continue other project work
- Monitor for any async-related issues in production use
