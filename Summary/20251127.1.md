# Session Summary: 2025-11-27 (Resubmit)

## Overview
This session focused on defining the user experience for the ASP (Agentic Software Process) Platform through three distinct lenses: The Engineering Manager, The Senior Developer, and The Product Manager.

## 1. User Stories (`docs/`)
We established emotional and practical narratives for three key personas:
*   **Sarah (Engineering Manager):** Focuses on "sleeping at night" via visibility, cost control, and quality gates. She values the "Overwatch" capability.
*   **Alex (Senior Developer):** Focuses on "flow state" by offloading boilerplate and validation to agents. He values the "Flow Canvas" and instant feedback.
*   **Jordan (Product Manager):** Focuses on "predictability" using PROBE-AI estimation. They value the "Prediction Engine" for accurate timelines.

## 2. UI Design Sketches (`docs/ui_designs/`)
We created high-level ASCII wireframes and design philosophies:
*   **ASP Overwatch:** A high-density "Cockpit" dashboard with dark mode, traffic light status indicators, and Sankey diagrams for process waste.
*   **Flow State Canvas:** An infinite canvas interface (node-based) where code, specs, and chat coexist. Features "Ghost Cursors" for active agents.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A timeline-based interface emphasizing probability clouds (fuzzy edges) and confidence intervals over hard deadlines.

## 3. Detailed Requirements (`docs/requirements/`)
We formalized the designs into technical requirements:
*   **Data Models:** defined in TypeScript (e.g., `Squad`, `CanvasNode`, `ProbeEstimate`).
*   **Input/Output:** Mapped API calls and user interactions.
*   **Visuals:** Included full HTML/CSS mockups embedded in the markdown to demonstrate the "modern, clean" aesthetic (using CSS variables, flexbox/grid).

## Key Decisions
*   **Personas:** Standardized on Sarah, Alex, and Jordan (using they/them pronouns).
*   **Aesthetics:** Distinct visual vibes for each role (Fintech for Manager, IDE/Creative for Dev, SaaS/Friendly for PM).
*   **Tech Stack Assumptions:** TypeScript interfaces imply a typed frontend; HTML/CSS mockups assume a component-based architecture.
