# Session Summary - 2025-12-24 Session 1

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-23 Session 3 (summary20251223.3.md)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**Summary:** Session 3 synced with GitHub, verified 75.23% coverage target was reached, and reviewed ADR status from the last 5 days.

## Work Completed

### Context Review
- Read summary20251223.1.md (coverage sprint session)
- Read summary20251223.3.md (GitHub sync session)
- Created this session summary

### Key Takeaways from Yesterday

**Session 1 (Dec 23):**
- Added 98 tests using "senior engineer approach" (happy path, error path, edge cases)
- Coverage improved: 71.42% -> 74.34%
- Recovered missing session summaries (20251222.3, 20251222.4)

**Session 3 (Dec 23):**
- Synced with GitHub (was 6 commits behind)
- **Coverage target reached: 75.23%**
- 1773 tests now passing
- All PRs 115-119 merged successfully

### Provider E2E Tests Created

Added end-to-end tests for LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenRouter, Groq):

- **Test file:** `tests/e2e/test_providers_e2e.py` (21 tests)
  - Tests skip automatically when API keys not present
  - Minimal token usage to reduce costs (<$0.01 per run)
  - Validates sync/async calls, response parsing, error handling

- **GitHub workflow:** `.github/workflows/provider-e2e.yml`
  - Runs manually, on provider code changes, and weekly
  - Supports ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, GROQ_API_KEY secrets

- **Documentation:** `docs/provider-e2e-testing.md`
  - Setup instructions for GitHub Actions secrets
  - Local testing guide
  - Cost estimates

### Decision: E2E Before More Providers

User wisely suggested adding e2e tests for existing providers before adding more (Gemini, Together, etc.). This de-risks the provider abstraction layer.
