## Outstanding Items from Last Week

### High Priority
1. **Test Coverage Expansion** - Currently at ~39%, target 80%
2. **E2E Mock Refinement** - Schema alignment needed (50% → 80%+ target)
3. **Web UI Implementation** - Session 20251130.8 incomplete

### Medium Priority
4. **Naming/Namespacing Design** - Deferred from Nov 29, needed for multi-project support
5. **Multi-Repo Phase 2-4** - RepositoryManager, fork detection, PR creation

### Lower Priority
6. **Branch Cleanup** - Merge accumulated branches
7. **nanoGPT PR** - Manual submission by user (git proxy limitation)

## Suggested Work for This Session

Based on the review, here are the top candidates:

### Option 1: Continue Web UI Implementation
- Session 20251130.8 was incomplete
- FastHTML stack approved in session 7
- Developer persona "Flow State Canvas" concept
- Would complete the design → implementation cycle started Nov 30

### Option 2: Test Coverage Push
- Critical gap: 39% vs 80% target
- Blocks CI/CD from enforcing coverage requirement
- Focus on low-coverage modules: code_review, design_review

### Option 3: E2E Mock Schema Alignment
- 50% pass rate → target 70%+
- Update mock responses to match Pydantic models exactly
- Would improve CI reliability

### Option 4: Naming/Namespacing Design
- Enables multi-project Langfuse support
- User mentioned trying ASP on another codebase
- Design doc would guide future implementation
