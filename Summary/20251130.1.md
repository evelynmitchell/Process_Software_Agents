# Session 20251130.1 Summary

**Date:** November 30, 2025
**Session ID:** 20251130.1
**Branch:** claude/colab-notebook-demo-test
**Topic:** Colab Notebook for External Repo Workflow

## Goals
- Create a Colab notebook that demonstrates checking out an external repo (`nanoGPT`) and running tests.
- Simulate the "external repo task" workflow within a notebook environment.
- Provide a self-contained artifact that the user can use in Google Colab.

## Context
- Previous sessions successfully tested `WorkspaceManager` and checking out `nanoGPT`.
- A limitation was found with the git proxy for pushing changes to external repos.
- The user requested to "test checking out a repo and doing a task on it, but I'd like you to do it within a colab notebook."

## Activities
- Review previous session summaries and artifacts (`contrib/nanogpt-tests/`).
- Create `notebooks/ASP_External_Repo_Test.ipynb` which encapsulates the workflow:
    - Install dependencies.
    - Clone `nanoGPT`.
    - Inject test files from the notebook (or download them).
    - Run the tests.
    - Display results.
- Verify the notebook content by checking the generated file.

## Outcomes
- [x] `notebooks/ASP_External_Repo_Test.ipynb` created.
- [x] Verification that the notebook cells contain the correct logic.
