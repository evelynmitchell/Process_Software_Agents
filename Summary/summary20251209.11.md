# Session Summary - 2025-12-09 Session 11

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## Completeness Checklist

Before closing the session, verify:

### Required (Claude fills)
- [x] Metadata complete (date, session#, commits, status)
- [x] Objective is one clear sentence
- [x] Work completed has concrete deliverables
- [x] Files changed table is accurate
- [x] End commit hash updated
- [x] Status updated to Complete/Blocked

### Required (Human fills)
- [ ] Previous session outcome assessed (or "N/A" if first)
- [ ] Interventions logged (or "none" noted)
- [ ] Rating provided (1-5)

### Optional but Valuable
- [ ] What worked / didn't work filled in

---

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-09 Session 10 (max_tokens increase for review agents)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed

## Technical Notes

### Error Message Pattern Changes (from Session 9)
The centralized JSON extraction utility changed error messages:
- **Old:** `"Failed to parse X review response"`, `"missing 'field_name' field"`
- **New:** `"Failed to parse LLM response"`, `"Response missing required fields: ['field']"`

### ComponentLogic Model Design
The `interfaces` field uses `default_factory=list` and explicitly allows empty lists per the comment "can be empty for simple modules". The test was incorrectly expecting validation failure.

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Run full E2E stability test** - Verify pipeline with all fixes
2. **Continue HITL integration testing** - End-to-end approval flow in containers
3. **Address Test Agent defects** - 66/68 tests passed, 2 defects remain
