# Session Summary - 2025-12-18 Session 1

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-16 Session 6

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

**Summary:** Session 6 completed ADR 009 Phase 2 (Kanban UI "Plan with ASP" button). All 4 phases of ADR 009 are now complete.

## Work Completed

### Review of Recent Work
- Reviewed session summaries from 2025-12-16 (sessions 2, 4, 5, 6)
- Reviewed ADR 008 (Async Process Architecture) - all 5 phases complete
- Reviewed ADR 009 (Beads Planning Integration) - all 4 phases complete
- Reviewed ADR 010 (Multi-LLM Provider Support) - draft status

### ADR 011: Claude CLI and Agent SDK Integration
Created comprehensive ADR exploring:
- **Problem:** Current ASP uses direct Anthropic API; users with subscriptions pay twice
- **Solution:** Integrate Claude Agent SDK as an alternative provider
- **Four options proposed:**
  - Option A: SDK as LLM provider (recommended start)
  - Option B: Hybrid mode (SDK for tools, API for LLM)
  - Option C: Full agentic delegation
  - Option D: Expose ASP agents as MCP tools
- **Benefits identified:**
  - Subscription-based pricing support
  - Built-in context management and session persistence
  - Optional tool execution delegation (Edit, Bash, Git)
- **Implementation plan:** 3-phase approach starting with SDK as provider

## Technical Notes

- Claude Agent SDK requires Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+
- SDK supports both subscription auth (interactive login) and API key auth
- SDK has built-in tools (Edit, Bash, Read, Glob, Grep) that overlap with ASP tools
- Recommendation is to start with SDK as LLM-only provider (disable built-in tools)
- ADR 011 relates to both ADR 008 (async) and ADR 010 (multi-provider)

---

## Next Session

- Review ADR 011 and decide on implementation approach
- If approved, begin Phase 1: Create `ClaudeSDKProvider` class
- Consider how this integrates with ADR 010 provider abstraction
