# Session Summary - 2025-12-17 Session 6

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

---

## Completeness Checklist

Before closing the session, verify:

### Required (Claude fills)
- [x] Metadata complete (date, session#, commits, status)
- [x] Objective is one clear sentence
- [x] Work completed has concrete deliverables
- [x] Files changed table is accurate
- [x] End commit hash updated
- [x] Status updated to Complete/Blocked

### Required (Human fills)
- [ ] Previous session outcome assessed (or "N/A" if first)
- [ ] Interventions logged (or "none" noted)
- [ ] Rating provided (1-5)

### Optional but Valuable
- [ ] What worked / didn't work filled in
- [x] Technical notes for future sessions
- [x] Next session priorities listed

**Completeness Score:** 6/6 required (Claude), ___/3 required (Human), 2/3 optional

## Objective

Implement ADR 008 Phase 4: Async Orchestrators (TSPOrchestrator.execute_async, PlanningDesignOrchestrator.execute_async).

---

## Previous Session Outcome

**Last Session:** 2025-12-17 Session 5 (summary20251217.5.md)

**Outcome:**
- [ ] Fully used - work shipped/merged, no changes needed
- [ ] Partially used - some rework required
- [ ] Not used - reverted, replaced, or abandoned
- [x] Too early - not enough time to assess
- [ ] N/A - first session or no prior deliverables

## ADR 008 Implementation Status

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Async LLM Calls | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 | Async Agent Pattern | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3 | Async Services | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 4 | Async Orchestrators | ⏳ This Session |
| Phase 5 | CLI Integration | ⏳ Pending |

### Phase 4 Targets
- `TSPOrchestrator.execute_async()` - parallel codegen, parallel reviews
- `PlanningDesignOrchestrator.execute_async()` - parallel specialists

---

## Work Completed

### Phase 4: Async Orchestrators (Complete)

**PlanningDesignOrchestrator.execute_async():**
- Full async implementation of planning → design → review workflow
- Async helper methods: `_execute_planning_async`, `_execute_design_async`, `_execute_design_review_async`
- Same feedback loop logic as sync version

**TSPOrchestrator.execute_async():**
- Full async implementation of 7-agent pipeline
- Async helper methods for all phases: planning, design+review, code+review, testing, postmortem
- Quality gates and HITL override support maintained
- Same iteration limits and error handling as sync version

### Tests Added

**test_orchestrator.py - TestAsyncPlanningDesignOrchestrator (2 tests):**
- `test_async_orchestrator_simple_pass` - Async pass on first try
- `test_async_design_feedback_loop` - Async feedback loop with redesign

## Technical Notes

### ADR 008 Progress
| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1: Async LLM Calls | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2: Async Agent Pattern | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3: Async Services | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 4: Async Orchestrators | ✅ Complete (this session) |
| Phase 5: CLI Integration | ⏳ Remaining |

### Implementation Notes
- Orchestrator async methods mirror sync logic exactly
- Quality gates unchanged (same iteration limits, HITL override)
- All agents called via `execute_async()` instead of `execute()`
- No parallelization within orchestrator phases (pipeline dependencies)
- Review orchestrators already had internal parallelism (specialist dispatch)

### Test Results
- 5 orchestrator unit tests passing (3 sync + 2 async)
- Verified async methods exist and are properly typed

---

## Next Session Priorities

- Phase 5: Add CLI integration with `asyncio.run()` wrappers
- Consider adding async wrapper scripts for common workflows
- Documentation updates for async usage patterns
