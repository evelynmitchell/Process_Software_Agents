# Session 20251128.1 Summary

## Goals
- Review previous session summary (20251126.6).
- Create this summary file for session 1 of November 28, 2025.
- Catch up on project status and determine next steps.

## Activities
1. **Session Initialization:**
   - Reviewed summary from session 20251126.6.
   - Merged PR #52 to obtain November 27 summary.
   - Reviewed summary from session 20251127.1.
   - Created this summary file for the current session.

## Key Context from Previous Sessions

**Session 20251127.1 (November 27):**
- Focus: UI/UX design and requirements documentation for ASP Platform
- Created user stories for three personas:
  - Sarah (Engineering Manager): Needs visibility, cost control, quality gates ("Overwatch")
  - Alex (Senior Developer): Needs flow state, instant feedback ("Flow Canvas")
  - Jordan (Product Manager): Needs predictability, accurate timelines ("Prediction Engine")
- Delivered UI design sketches:
  - ASP Overwatch: Dark mode dashboard with traffic light indicators, Sankey diagrams
  - Flow State Canvas: Infinite canvas with node-based interface, "Ghost Cursors" for agents
  - Prediction Engine: Timeline-based with probability clouds and confidence intervals
- Created detailed requirements with TypeScript data models and HTML/CSS mockups
- Established distinct visual vibes for each persona (Fintech/IDE/SaaS aesthetics)

**Session 20251126.6 (November 26):**
- Validated E2E test mocking strategy across all agent types
- Improved MockLLMClient with intelligent agent detection
- E2E Test Results: 30/60 passing (50%) with mock LLM
- Successfully passing test files:
  - test_planning_agent_e2e.py: 16/16 (100%)
  - test_code_review_orchestrator_e2e.py: 8/8 (100%)
  - test_design_review_agent_e2e.py: 3/3 (100%)
  - test_tsp_orchestrator_e2e.py: 3/8 (38%)
- Test files needing mock response refinement:
  - test_design_agent_e2e.py: 0/5 (schema mismatch)
  - test_design_agent_markdown_e2e.py: 0/7 (needs markdown response)
  - test_code_agent_e2e.py: 0/3 (schema needs refinement)
  - test_all_agents_hello_world_e2e.py: 0/4 (multi-agent pipeline)
  - test_tsp_with_approval_service.py: 0/5 (TSP pipeline)

**Earlier Key Progress (Session 20251126.3-5):**
- Session 3: Created MockLLMClient, added 8 unhappy path tests, 586/622 unit tests passing (94%)
- Session 4: Extended E2E test mocking to all 9 E2E test files
- Session 5: Fixed JSON parsing in MockLLMClient, all 16 planning agent tests passing

## Current State

**Testing Infrastructure (Nov 26 session):**
- ✅ All E2E tests support mock LLM (no API key required)
- ✅ MockLLMClient supports 6 major agent types with intelligent detection
- ✅ Unit tests: 586/622 passing (94%)
- ⚠️ E2E tests: 30/60 passing (50%)
- ⚠️ Overall coverage: 39% (target: 80%)
- ⚠️ 36 unit test failures remaining

**UI/UX Documentation (Nov 27 session):**
- ✅ User stories defined for 3 key personas
- ✅ UI design sketches created (ASCII wireframes + design philosophy)
- ✅ Detailed requirements with TypeScript models and HTML/CSS mockups
- ✅ Documentation in docs/user_stories, docs/ui_designs, docs/requirements

## Identified Next Steps

**Testing Infrastructure (from Nov 26):**
1. Refine Design mock response schema to match DesignSpecification Pydantic model exactly
2. Add missing fields: semantic_unit_id, interfaces, implementation_notes, validation_criteria
3. Test and refine Code/Test agent mock schemas
4. Complete multi-agent pipeline mock support
5. Fix remaining 36 unit test failures
6. Increase test coverage in low-coverage modules (code_review, design_review, database)
7. Address coverage gap to reach 80% target

**UI/UX Implementation (potential next steps):**
1. Begin implementing UI components based on Nov 27 designs
2. Set up frontend framework (implied TypeScript stack)
3. Create component library aligned with persona aesthetics
4. Implement data models defined in requirements docs

## Awaiting User Input
Ready to continue work on either:
- Testing infrastructure improvements (mock schemas, unit test fixes, coverage)
- UI/UX implementation (frontend components based on Nov 27 designs)
- Other priorities
