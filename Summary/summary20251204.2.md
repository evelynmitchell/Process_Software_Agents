# Session Summary - 2025-12-04 Session 2

## Objective
Review ADR 005 (Development Process Graph Learning) in detail and prepare for implementation.

---

## Prior Session Summary (Session 1 Today)

| Session | Focus | Key Outcome |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Process Mining ADRs | Created ADR 004 and ADR 005 |

**Key Decisions from Session 1:**
- ADR 004: Process Graph Learning from Program Execution (runtime traces)
- ADR 005: Development Process Graph Learning from Summary+Git
- Unified approach using PM4Py for both runtime and development process mining

---

## Completed Work

### 1. Context Review

Reviewed recent session summaries and ADR 005 to establish context:
- ADR 005 proposes mining development process from existing artifacts
- No new instrumentation needed - parses Summary/*.md and git history
- Same PM4Py techniques as ADR 004 for runtime traces

### 2. ADR 005 Detailed Analysis

(In progress - see discussion below)

---

## ADR 005 Key Points

### Data Sources
1. **Session Summaries** (`Summary/summary*.md`) - ~95 files
2. **Git History** - commits, branches, file changes
3. **GitHub PRs** (optional) - reviews, merges

### Proposed Components
| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `DevelopmentEvent` | Event schema dataclass | `src/asp/telemetry/dev_events.py` |
| `SummaryParser` | Parse markdown to events | `src/asp/telemetry/parsers/summary_parser.py` |
| `GitLogParser` | Parse git log to events | `src/asp/telemetry/parsers/git_parser.py` |
| `EventCorrelator` | Link commits to sessions | `src/asp/telemetry/correlate.py` |
| `dev_process_mining` | PM4Py analysis | `src/asp/telemetry/dev_process_mining.py` |

### Event Types
```
session.start, session.end, objective.set, task.started, task.completed,
file.created, file.modified, file.deleted, commit.created, branch.created,
branch.merged, pr.opened, pr.merged, test.passed, test.failed
```

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `Summary/summary20251204.2.md` | Session summary (this file) |

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Deep dive into ADR 005 implementation details
- [ ] Identify any gaps or refinements needed
- [ ] Begin Phase 1 implementation (parsers)

## Status
In Progress
