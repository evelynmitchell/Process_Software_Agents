# Session Summary - 2025-12-16 Session 4

## North Star Metric: Effective Work Rate

**Definition:** (work that stuck) / (total work done)

"Work that stuck" = still in codebase, not reverted, not redone, actually used.

We measure this by assessing *previous* session outcomes at the start of each new session.

## Work Completed

### ADR 009 Phase 3: Auto-sync Plans to Beads

Created `src/asp/utils/beads_sync.py` with:
- `sync_plan_to_beads()` - Creates Beads issues from ProjectPlan semantic units
  - Creates epic issue for task grouping
  - Creates task issues for each semantic unit
  - Assigns priority based on complexity
  - Adds labels for filtering (task-id, unit-id, complexity)
- `get_plan_issues()` - Retrieves Beads issues for a plan
- `update_unit_status()` - Updates status of a semantic unit's issue

Added `beads sync` CLI command:
- `asp beads sync plan.json` - Sync plan to Beads
- `--dry-run` - Preview what would be created
- `--no-epic` - Skip epic creation
- `--update` - Update existing issues
- `--list-after` - List issues after sync

### Tests
- Created `tests/unit/test_utils/test_beads_sync.py` (11 tests)
- Added 4 tests to `test_beads_commands.py` for sync CLI
- All 15 new tests pass
